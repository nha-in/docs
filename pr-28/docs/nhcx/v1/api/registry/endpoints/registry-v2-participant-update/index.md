# Submit the participant certificate and bridge update (v2)

`POST /v2/participant/update`

Stages a change to a participant encryption certificate and/or endpoint URL; returns a transactionid for passcode confirmation via /update/validate.

### Business purpose

Exactly two operational values rotate over a participant's life: the public encryption certificate that counterparties encrypt claims data with, and the endpoint (bridge) URL that the gateway delivers callbacks to. Both are security-sensitive, so the v2 update takes only those fields and gates the change behind an SMS passcode to the registered mobile number. It is step 3 of the production onboarding sequence, where a newly confirmed participant publishes its certificate for the first time, and the documented route for annual key rotation thereafter.

### When to use

Use it immediately after creation confirmation (/validate) to upload encryptioncert and endpointurl, and again whenever either value changes; always follow with GET /update/validate within 24 hours. The production URL is https://apisprod.NHA.gov.in/pmjay/hcx/participanthcxservice/v2/participant/update. If only the certificate changes and passcode validation is not wanted, /v2/update/cert is the documented alternative. This is a synchronous JSON registry call with no workflow or x-hcx-status codes.

### Preconditions

- participantcode is a valid code already registered in NHCX and its creation confirmation has been completed.
- The certificate (public key) is Base64-encoded; the update validation explicitly requires this.
- Bearer token in bearer_auth with the Bearer prefix, Accept and Content-Type: application/json.
- ParticipantCertUpdateRequest: participantcode required; encryptioncert and endpointurl optional (the base URL).
- The new private key is already deployed on the callback host so decryption works the moment the change goes live.

### Postconditions

HTTP 200 with ParticipantCertUpdateResp: participant_code, status and transactionid. A passcode is sent to the registered mobile number; the pair is valid for 24 hours and each new trigger replaces it. The change is not live until GET /update/validate succeeds, after which /fetch/certs returns the new certificate and callbacks go to the new endpoint. Counterparties may serve a cached copy for up to 24 hours. Errors use the 400/404/500 ErrorResponse envelope.

### Common mistakes

- Calling it before creation has been confirmed with /validate; the validations require a confirmed participant code.
- Sending the raw PEM instead of the Base64-encoded certificate.
- Using v1 field names (participant_code, encryption_cert, endpoint_URL) in this flattened lowercase body.
- Treating the 200 as completion and skipping /update/validate, so the old certificate stays live.
- Re-triggering the update while a passcode is pending, invalidating the earlier transaction ID.
- Losing the transaction ID, which forces the update to be issued again.

### Best practices

- Prepare the new key pair, deploy the PKCS8 private key to the callback host and only then publish the certificate.
- Keep the previous private key available for at least 24 hours after validation to decrypt callbacks encrypted against a cached certificate.
- Persist transactionid with its 24-hour expiry and complete /update/validate promptly.
- Rotate encryption keys once a year, matching the 365-day validity of the self-signed certificate.
- Verify the new endpointurl is a domain name on an India-based server with the NHCX NAT IPs whitelisted before submitting.

### Related scenario

A TPA has just confirmed its production participant with /validate. Its engineers generate a 2048-bit RSA key, a 365-day self-signed X.509 certificate, Base64-encode it and deploy the private key to the callback host. They call /v2/participant/update with participantcode, encryptioncert and endpointurl; the response returns status and a transactionid, and the registered phone receives a passcode. After GET /update/validate succeeds, the first provider to call /fetch/certs for the TPA receives the new certificate and can encrypt a pre-authorisation for it.

### Specification

Chapter [Your certificate](/docs/nhcx/v1/getting-started/your-certificate) of the NHCX integration specification.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice/v2/participant/update \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSIONS_CALL>' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <access token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "participantcode": "XXXXX7583@hcx",
  "encryptioncert": "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0t...",
  "endpointurl": "https://nhcx.demotpa.example.in"
}'
```

## Authorization

- `Authorization` (bearer token, required): On every NHCX call, the token goes in a header called `bearer_auth`, with the word `Bearer` and a space in front. The sources are not unanimous: the authentication page and the FAQ both write the example as `Authorization`, and the notification endpoint uses `Authorization`. The safe course, and what the adapter does, is to send both headers with the same value.

## Headers

- `bearer_auth` (string, required): It is `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`, on NHCX's own endpoints.

## Body

- `participantcode` (string)
- `encryptioncert` (string)
- `endpointurl` (string)

## Responses

- `200`: HTTP 200 with ParticipantCertUpdateResp: participant_code, status and transactionid.
