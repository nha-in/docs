# FHIR

Every FHIR resource the application builds for NHCX or reads from a hospital's message, in one list. Each row links to its full spec in [../fhir/](../fhir/INDEX.md). Sent profiles are the NRCeS profiles under `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/`; received resources are read without checking a profile.

## Envelope

| # | Resource | Direction | What it is | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [F1](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) | Bundle | both | The envelope of every message: ids, profiles, entry order and absolute references; what this payer wraps its answers in and how it unwraps a hospital's bundle. | [A5](../apis/A5-query-request.md), [A12](../apis/A12-txn-fhir.md), [A15](../apis/A15-case-exchange.md), [C1](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md), [C9](../callbacks/C9-communication.md) |

## Queries and payment
