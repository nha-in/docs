# D1. payer

#### D1T. TABLE
One row is the insurer this deployment belongs to; primary key `id`. One row in practice: a table so the payer on every screen and every bundle has somewhere to come from. No parent table. The reference implementation names it `payer_payers` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D1D. DESCRIPTION
The payer's own record. It is the payer Organization ([F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md)) on every bundle this system sends, the `x-hcx-sender_code` of every answer (A1. Eligibility Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer) to A10. Predetermination Quote (in nhcx-preauth/payer)), and the `payerid` on an ABHA policy link (A16. ABHA Policy Link (in nhcx-coverage/payer)).

Create:
- Written once when the deployment is set up (the reference seeds it at first boot with a name, a code, a city and a state [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)). Only `id`, `name` and `code` are required.

Update:
- Edited from the Organisation screen (S12. Organisation (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) through `PATCH payer`: every column but `id` and `created_at`. The participant codes are stored the way the exchange spells them, with the `@hcx` suffix added when it was left off, so what the screen shows is what goes on the wire. A `code` already taken by another row is refused with "That payer code is already registered".

Read:
- Every outbound answer reads this row for the sender code and the Organization. `nhcx_participant_id` empty falls back to the gateway's configured default participant ([G2. Configuration and Participants](../gateway/G2-configuration.md)); `nhcx_processing_id` empty means the payer processes its own claims.
- The cases a signed-in account sees are those addressed to a participant code it works; the deployment's own code here is the default when an account names none [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

Delete:
- Never.
