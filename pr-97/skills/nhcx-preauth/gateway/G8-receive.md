# G8. Receive

#### G8E. ENTRY
HTTP routes the gateway serves for NHCX (mounted by G1 on the application's listener, no API key):

| Route | NHCX path handed on |
|---|---|
| `POST /in/<path>` | `<path>`, for example `v1/preauth/on_submit` (registry `endpoint_url` ending `/in`) |
| `POST /v1/<path>` | `v1/<path>` (registry `endpoint_url` at the root) |

In-process, the gateway then calls the application's callback door once per accepted message:

- `C1.receive(envelope, delivery) -> outcome` (the application's function; G8 is its only caller)

Internal steps, exposed for tests: `gateway.receive(path, body, remote_addr) -> Inbound`, `gateway.record_inbound(inbound, result, error)`, `gateway.record_refused(path, remote_addr, peeked_headers, error)`.

#### G8D. DESCRIPTION
NHCX posts `{"payload": "<compact JWE>"}` for every message addressed to a participant whose registry `endpoint_url` points at this application. The gateway decrypts it, works out who it was addressed to, hands the decrypted envelope to C1 in-process and waits for C1's result. Only then does it answer NHCX: `202` with the acceptance body when C1 took the message, an error status otherwise. NHCX redelivers a message it did not see accepted, five attempts in all, then drops the correlation id. So C1 must be idempotent on `x-hcx-api_call_id` / `x-hcx-correlation_id`; the gateway marks a repeat with `redelivery = true`.

A body without `payload` is not encrypted: a `ProtocolResponse` or error notice carries its protocol headers as top-level `x-hcx-*` keys. It is handed to C1 as it is, kind `protocol` (or `json` when it has no `x-hcx-*` key and no `type`).

Recipient resolution, for an encrypted message:
1. Read `x-hcx-recipient_code` from the JWE protected header without decrypting.
2. A code the gateway hosts (default participant, `participants`, or a code added with the host option, G2) is local. A non-empty code that is not local is a guest.
3. A guest with guests not enabled (G2) is refused `WRONG_RECIPIENT` before decryption.
4. Decrypt with the addressed participant's private key first, then every other hosted participant's key, each distinct key once. Hosted codes that share the default's certificate share its key, so this is one attempt in the common case.
5. No key opens it: a guest is refused `WRONG_RECIPIENT` (it was never meant for here); anything else is `DECRYPT_FAILED`.
6. `participant` for the delivery is the guest's own code for a guest, else the code of the profile whose key was addressed (or the first profile whose key opened it). For a protocol message it is its `x-hcx-recipient_code`, as sent.

Guests are how one deployment serves any participant code whose registry record carries this gateway's `endpoint_url` and one of its certificates. The application decides from `participant` (and the path) which desk the message belongs to.

#### G8Q. INPUT
From NHCX (HTTP):

| Part | Value |
|---|---|
| body | `{"payload": "<compact JWE>"}` (JSON object), or a plain protocol JSON object. Limit `maxBodyBytes`, default 100 MiB |
| peer address | the TCP peer; `X-Forwarded-For` is not trusted |

To C1 (in-process). `envelope`:

```json
{"meta": {"type": "in", "payloadType": "fhir", "path": "v1/preauth/on_submit",
          "ip": "10.0.0.5", "time": "2026-09-21T12:01:05+05:30",
          "redelivery": false, "participant": "<facility code>"},
 "jwe_headers": {"alg": "RSA-OAEP-256", "enc": "A256GCM",
                 "x-hcx-sender_code": "<payer code>", "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<facility code>",
                 "x-hcx-correlation_id": "...", "x-hcx-api_call_id": "...", "...": "..."},
 "fhir": {"resourceType": "Bundle", "...": "..."}}
```

`jwe_headers` is the whole protected header (or, for a protocol message, its top-level `x-hcx-*` keys), with null values dropped and sender and recipient codes given the `@hcx` suffix. `fhir` is the decrypted payload (a non-JSON plaintext becomes a JSON string), or the whole plain body for a protocol message.

`delivery`, passed as an argument beside the envelope:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `path` | the NHCX path, slashes trimmed |
| `type` | entity of the path: `coverage` (coverageeligibility), `insurance` (insuranceplan), `preauth`, `claim`, `task`, `communication`, `payment` (paymentnotice), `status` (`v1/on_status`), `error` (`v1/error`), otherwise the path's entity segment. These short names are [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) |
| `flow` | `request` for a response path (`on_...`), `on_request` otherwise (naming kept as the reference implementation has it [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) |
| `payload_kind` | `fhir`, `protocol` or `json` |
| `correlation_id` | `x-hcx-correlation_id`, may be empty |
| `api_call_id` | `x-hcx-api_call_id`; stable across NHCX's redeliveries, so it is the dedupe key |
| `redelivery` | the ledger already holds an inbound row with this `api_call_id` |
| `participant` | the addressed code, resolved as in G8D |

#### G8S. OUTPUT
C1's result, and what NHCX is answered:

| C1 result | Ledger status | NHCX gets |
|---|---|---|
| returns an outcome (`settled`, `unmatched`, `ignored`) | `delivered` | `202` with the acceptance body |
| returns `rejected` (unreadable body; redelivery cannot help) | `delivered`, outcome `rejected` kept on `peer.outcome` | `202` with the acceptance body; no redelivery |
| returns `error`, or raises | `delivery_failed`, error `RECEIVE_FAILED`, retryable | `502` error body; NHCX redelivers |

A `rejected` message is accepted so NHCX does not redeliver a body that can never be read. The ledger entry is written after C1 returns, so it carries the outcome.

The gateway keeps C1's answer on the ledger row as `peer` (`url` = the in-process handler name, `status_code` = the equivalent status, `response` = the outcome body).

Acceptance body (`202`, and response header `X-Nhcx-Ledger-Id: <ledger id>` when recorded):

```json
{"timestamp": "21/09/2026 12:01:05:480",
 "api_call_id": "<x-hcx-api_call_id, or a fresh UUID when it is not one>",
 "correlation_id": "<x-hcx-correlation_id, or a fresh UUID when it is not one>",
 "result": {"sender_code": "<payer code>", "recipient_code": "<facility code>",
            "entity_type": "preauth", "protocol_status": "request.queued"},
 "error": null}
```

`entity_type` is the path's entity in protocol spelling (`coverageeligibility`, `insuranceplan`, `preauth`, `claim`, `task`, `communication`, `payment`, `status`). `timestamp` is local time as `DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss:mmm`.

Error body to NHCX (any failure):

```json
{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "WRONG_RECIPIENT", "message": "...", "retryable": false},
 "request_id": "<X-Request-Id or a fresh UUID>", "upstream_status": 400, "upstream_body": {"...": "..."}}
```

`upstream_status` and `upstream_body` appear only for callback failures (C1's equivalent status and body).

| Code | NHCX gets | Ledger | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BODY_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | none | body over `maxBodyBytes` |
| `BODY_READ` | 400 | none | body could not be read |
| `INVALID_BODY` | 400 | `rejected`, kind `unknown` | body not a JSON object |
| `INVALID_JWE` | 400 | `rejected`, kind `unknown` | `payload` not a compact JWE string, or its protected header unreadable |
| `WRONG_RECIPIENT` | 400 | `rejected`, kind `unknown` | a code not hosted and guests off; or a guest no key opens |
| `DECRYPT_FAILED` | 422 | `rejected`, kind `unknown` | no hosted key opens a message for a hosted (or absent) code |
| `RECEIVE_FAILED` | 502 | `delivery_failed` | C1 answered `error` or raised, table above |
| `MARSHAL_ERROR` | 500 | `rejected` | the envelope could not be encoded |
| `INTERNAL` | 500 | none | a panic in the handler |

A refused message is recorded with the headers peeked from its JWE (no decryption), so its ids are visible in the ledger. An `api_call_id` recorded this way also counts for the next delivery's `redelivery` flag.
