# D6. subscription

#### D6T. TABLE
One row is one enrolment of one member ([D5. member](D5-member.md)) on one product ([D12. policy](D12-policy.md)) for one cover period; primary key `id`. Parent tables [D5. member](D5-member.md) and [D12. policy](D12-policy.md). The reference implementation names it `payer_subscriptions` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D6D. DESCRIPTION
The cover. An eligibility check (C2. Coverage Eligibility Check (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) is answered from this row: in force when `status` is `active` and today lies inside `pstart` to `pend`, lapsed when the newest enrolment the handles find is not, no cover when none is found (A1. Eligibility Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer)). The wallet is what the answer reports as the benefit left ([F3. CoverageEligibilityResponse](../fhir/F3-coverage-eligibility-response.md)), and what a claim approval draws down ([A13. Adjudicate](../apis/A13-adjudicate.md)). The enrolment id is a handle this payer hands out: an eligibility answer names it, and a plan request quoting it back (C3. Insurance Plan Request (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) resolves to this person's cover rather than the product alone.

Create:
- From the Subscriptions screen (S5. Subscriptions (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) through `POST subscriptions`. `id` is `SUB-<serial>` from the `subscription` counter ([D32. id_sequence](D32-id-sequence.md)), five digits [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The period is validated (`pend` not before `pstart`); the opening wallet balance is honoured only here. Family members (D7. subscription_family_member (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) are written with it when `sub_type` is `Family Floater`.
- Refused when the member is already enrolled on the same policy ("already enrolled on that policy", `uq_subscriptions_member_policy`), or the member or policy does not exist.

Update:
- `PATCH subscriptions/:id`: period, type, plan type and the family list (replaced whole). `POST subscriptions/:id/status` sets `active` or `paused`.
- The wallet moves only through a ledgered write ([D8. wallet_entry](D8-wallet-entry.md)): a manual adjustment from the screen (`POST subscriptions/:id/wallet`, credit or debit with a reason), the debit of the approved amount when a claim is approved ([A13. Adjudicate](../apis/A13-adjudicate.md)), and the credit of the same amount when a decided claim is reopened ([C7. Task Submit](../callbacks/C7-task-submit.md) reprocess). The row is locked, the balance and the ledger entry are written in one transaction, and a debit below zero is refused ("Insufficient wallet balance").
- ABHA link state moves only through A16. ABHA Policy Link (in nhcx-coverage/payer): a link that took at ABDM sets `abha_linked`, `abha_no`, `abha_token`, `abha_link_status` `linked`, `abha_linked_at`; a delink clears them and sets `delinked`; a refusal sets `failed` and `abha_request_id` and nothing else; a link recorded with no gateway configured sets the number and leaves `abha_link_status` at `none`, because the exchange has been told nothing. Every attempt writes a row in D9. abha_link_event (in nhcx-coverage/payer).

Statuses (`status`): `active`, `paused`. `abha_link_status`: `none`, `linked`, `delinked`, `failed`.

Delete:
- Soft: `deleted_at` set. Cases filed against it stay (`RESTRICT` on [D19. case](D19-case.md)).

A product retired from under an enrolment is repointed to the default product at boot [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D6K. KEYS AND INDEXES
- Primary key `id`.
- Unique `uq_subscriptions_member_policy` on `(member_id, policy_id)`: one wallet per member per product.
- Foreign keys: `member_id` references [D5. member](D5-member.md) `id`, `policy_id` references [D12. policy](D12-policy.md) `id`, both `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.
- Checks: `ck_subscriptions_status`; `ck_subscriptions_sub_type`; `ck_subscriptions_abha_link_status`; `ck_subscriptions_wallet` (`wallet_balance >= 0`); `ck_subscriptions_abha` (`abha_linked` implies `abha_no` set); `ck_subscriptions_abha_no` (null or 14 digits); `ck_subscriptions_period` (`pend >= pstart`); `ck_subscriptions_owner_len`.
- Indexes: `idx_subscriptions_live` on `(deleted_at, status)`; `idx_subscriptions_policy` on `policy_id`; `idx_subscriptions_period` on `(deleted_at, pend, pstart)`, for "whose cover is live today" and "whose lapses this month"; `idx_subscriptions_owner` on `owner_client_id`.
- Referenced by D7. subscription_family_member (in nhcx-coverage/payer), [D8. wallet_entry](D8-wallet-entry.md) and D9. abha_link_event (in nhcx-coverage/payer) (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) and by [D19. case](D19-case.md) `subscription_id` (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`).
