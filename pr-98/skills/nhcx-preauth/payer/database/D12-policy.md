# D12. policy

#### D12T. TABLE
One row is one product the payer sells: what it covers and up to how much; primary key `id`. No parent table. The cover period belongs to the enrolment ([D6. subscription](D6-subscription.md)), not the product. The reference implementation names it `payer_policies` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D12D. DESCRIPTION
The product is what a plan request (C3. Insurance Plan Request (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) names and what the InsurancePlan ([F5. InsurancePlan](../fhir/F5-insuranceplan.md)) renders: this row for the identity, type and sum assured, with its children for the covered procedures ([D13. policy_procedure](D13-policy-procedure.md)), coverage clauses and benefits ([D14. policy_coverage_clause](D14-policy-coverage-clause.md), [D15. policy_clause_benefit](D15-policy-clause-benefit.md)), aliases ([D16. policy_alias](D16-policy-alias.md)), exclusions ([D17. policy_exclusion](D17-policy-exclusion.md)) and sub-limits ([D18. policy_sub_limit](D18-policy-sub-limit.md)).

Finding the product a hospital means (A2. Insurance Plan Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer)): by `id`, by `uin`, by an alias, or by the enrolment id an eligibility answer handed out (which resolves through [D6. subscription](D6-subscription.md) to the person's own cover). A code that names a retired product resolves to the default product the enrolments were moved onto [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); a code matching nothing is answered with an empty plan, not refused.

Create:
- From the Policy Configurator (S7. Policy Configurator (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) through `POST policies`. `id` is `POL` plus the filing day code and a three-character counter that restarts each day, in the sortable base32 alphabet, for example `POL7UMV001` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). `type_code` and `plan_type_code` come from the value sets in [D4. terminology_code](D4-terminology-code.md); `total_assured` must be positive. The children are written in the same transaction.

Update:
- `PATCH policies/:id`: the columns here and every child list, replaced whole.
- The default product every account sees is read-only for everyone and cannot be removed [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

Statuses (`status`): `draft`, `active`, `retired`, `unknown`. Only the product's filing state; an enrolment's own `status` says whether cover is in force.

Delete:
- Soft: `deleted_at` set. Refused while anybody is still enrolled on it ("still referenced").
