# F9. ClaimResponse

#### F9R. RESOURCE
`ClaimResponse`, no profile, the `SUBSETTED` tag (F1). Direction: sent on `v1/preauth/on_submit` (a pre-authorisation, an enhancement, a predetermination: A3. Pre-auth Answer (in nhcx-preauth/payer), A10. Predetermination Quote (in nhcx-preauth/payer)) and on `v1/claim/on_submit` (a claim: A4. Claim Answer (in nhcx-claim/payer)), on the submission's correlation id; and inside the Task answer on `v1/task/on_submit` when a reprocessed claim is decided (F10, A9. Task Answer (in nhcx-preauth/payer)). Beside it, in the scheme's order: the Patient (F15), the payer Organization, the hospital Organization (F17), the Coverage (F18), every fullUrl resolvable under `<payer base>/preauthorization/v1/preauth/on_submit/claimresponse` or `<payer base>/claim/v1/claim/on_submit/claimresponse`.

#### F9D. DESCRIPTION
The same resource is sent twice on one thread: once when the submission is filed and once when a person decides. Nothing in it is decided by rules; everything comes off the case ([D19. case](../database/D19-case.md)) and its lines ([D25. case_line_item](../database/D25-case-line-item.md)).

**Outcome and status together.** A hospital never reads `outcome` alone: it takes `outcome` and the claim-level `adjudication[]` entry categorised `status` as a pair [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). This payer writes exactly one such entry, `category.coding[0].code` `status`, `reason.coding[0].code` the word, neither on a code system, and the pair is:

| Case decision (`D19.adjudication_status`) | `outcome` | status reason | `disposition` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pending` (the acknowledgement at filing) | `queued` | `submitted` | "Request acknowledged and accepted for further processing." |
| `approved`, in full | `complete` | `approved` | the remarks, else "Pre-authorisation approved for INR <approved>." |
| `approved`, less than claimed | `partial` | `approved` | the remarks, else "... approved for INR <approved> of INR <claimed> claimed." |
| `rejected` | `error` | `rejected` | the remarks, else "Pre-authorisation rejected." |
| `queried` | `partial` | `queried` | the remarks, else "More information is needed before this can be decided." |
| `cancelled` | `error` | `cancelled` | "The pre-authorisation was withdrawn." |

"Claim" replaces "Pre-authorisation" on the claim leg. A predetermination adds every rule finding to the disposition as "<rule> [<severity>] <path>: sent <x>; required <y>. <remedy>", because the scheme carries no `error[]` and no `processNote` and the disposition is the only place a finding can live [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) (A10. Predetermination Quote (in nhcx-preauth/payer)).

The acknowledgement goes out under workflow 20 (pre-authorisation) or 25 (claim) with `x-hcx-status` `response.partial`; a verdict under 21, 22, 23, 231, 26 or 291 with `response.complete` ([PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). A query is **not** sent as a ClaimResponse: the queried pair above is what a status enquiry or a preview renders, while the question itself travels as F11 on its own thread, so the submission's thread stays open until the reply is read and a decision made (A5. Query Request (in nhcx-communication/payer)).

**Per item.** One `item[]` per line of the case in position order, `itemSequence` from 1, `id` `Item/<D25.id>`, and four adjudications on the scheme's value set `https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-adjudication.html`: `submitted` (the claimed amount), `eligible` (the approved amount), `reason` (the adjudicator's words as a coding display: the query remarks, else the remarks, else "Not payable under this policy." on a rejected line; blank when the line was allowed in full, and then the disposition), and `status` (`Requested` until decided, then `Approved` for approved and partly approved lines, `Rejected`, `Queried`). A hospital keys its per-item table on these categories [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Totals by category, never by position.** `benefit` (the approved total), `submitted` (the claimed total), and `eligible` (the approved total again, with the element `id` `<member id>/<plan code>` the scheme writes). A pre-authorisation query carries no `eligible` total, as the scheme's does not; a claim query keeps it [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**`preAuthRef`.** This payer's case number (`D19.claim_no`, `CL/<yy>/<mmdd><serial>` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) on every pre-authorisation answer, the rejection included, and on the claim's acknowledgement but not on the claim's verdict, which is where the scheme writes it [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The hospital keeps the reference and quotes it on the claim; on the desk the case is found by it and by the hospital's own claim number (C5. Claim Submit (in nhcx-claim/payer)).

`type` (SNOMED `737481003` "Inpatient care management (procedure)" on `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/ValueSet/ndhm-claim-type`) is written on the pre-authorisation acknowledgement and on a Task's ClaimResponse only, as the scheme does [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
