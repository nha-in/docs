# D19. case

#### D19T. TABLE
One row is one claim dossier (case) around one enrolment, from the pre-authorisation that opened it to its settlement; primary key `id`, with `claim_no` as the number everyone quotes. Parent tables [D6. subscription](D6-subscription.md), D5. member (in nhcx-coverage/payer) and, for a dependant, D7. subscription_family_member (in nhcx-coverage/payer). The reference implementation names it `payer_cases` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D19D. DESCRIPTION
The case row. It holds who the patient is (snapshotted rather than joined: under a family floater the patient is often a dependant, and a claim must keep saying who it was for after the family list is edited), where they were treated, the admission, the running totals over the bill ([D25. case_line_item](D25-case-line-item.md)) and the payments ([D30. payment](D30-payment.md)), the decision, and the routing slips of every thread the case has with the exchange. Its children hold the diagnoses (D20. case_diagnosis (in nhcx-preauth/payer)), procedures (D21. case_procedure (in nhcx-preauth/payer)), doctors (D22. case_doctor (in nhcx-preauth/payer)), documents (D23. case_document (in nhcx-preauth/payer)), lines ([D25. case_line_item](D25-case-line-item.md)), timeline ([D26. case_timeline](D26-case-timeline.md)) and messages ([D27. case_exchange_message](D27-case-exchange-message.md)).

**Numbering.** `id` is `CASE-<serial>` from the `case` counter, four digits [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); it is a database key. `claim_no` is `CL/<yy>/<mmdd><serial>`, the month-and-day in three base32 characters and the serial in six over the sortable `0-9A-V` alphabet (`CL/26/0SE0000V9` is the 1001st claim, dated 10 September), from the `claim` counter ([D32. id_sequence](D32-id-sequence.md)) and dated from the admission [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). It is the number every screen shows and the `preAuthRef` every ClaimResponse ([F9. ClaimResponse](../fhir/F9-claimresponse.md)) carries. The hospital's own number (`Claim.identifier` typed `CLN`) is kept apart as `nhcx_claim_ref`.

**Created:**
- By C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer) from a pre-authorisation Claim (F8. Claim (in nhcx-preauth/payer)): the enrolment found by the handles the Claim carries (in force first, else the most recent cover, so a lapsed policy is filed and refused with the reason rather than dead-lettered), the member's own name, gender and age on the admission date, the hospital, the admission, diagnoses, team, lines and documents as sent, and the routing slip (`nhcx_correlation_id`, `nhcx_sender_code`, `nhcx_recipient_code`, `nhcx_claim_ref`). `stage` `preauth`, `adjudication_status` `pending`. A Claim naming no enrolment is refused permanently ("No enrolment matches the patient on this pre-authorisation").
- By C5. Claim Submit (in nhcx-claim/payer) from a Claim with no pre-authorisation on file: `stage` `claim`, with the discharge date the Claim carries (required for a direct claim) and the claim leg's slip (`nhcx_claim_correlation_id`, `nhcx_claim_submission_ref`).
- By hand from the desk ([S3. Case Desk](../screens/S3-case-desk.md), `POST cases`) with no routing slip, which is what "nothing is waiting for an answer" means [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- A redelivery finds its case by `nhcx_correlation_id` (unique) or `nhcx_claim_correlation_id` (unique) and opens no second one; two deliveries racing lose to the unique index ("That claim already exists").

**Stage and decision.** `stage`: `preauth`, `claim`, `payment`, `settled`, `rejected`, `cancelled`. `adjudication_status`: `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `queried`, `cancelled`. A case is open for decision while `stage` is `preauth` or `claim`; once money is in flight the numbers are fixed. A decision is a verdict and a time together, or neither (`ck_cases_adjudicated`).

| From | Write | Stage after | Status after |
|---|---|---|---|
| A13. Adjudicate (in nhcx-preauth/payer) approve at `preauth` | pending lines approved in full, totals recomputed | `claim` | `approved` |
| A13. Adjudicate (in nhcx-preauth/payer) approve at `claim` | as above, then the wallet ([D6. subscription](D6-subscription.md), D8. wallet_entry (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) debited by `total_approved`; refused when short ("Insufficient wallet balance"), when a line is still `queried`, or when every line is rejected | `payment` | `approved` |
| A13. Adjudicate (in nhcx-preauth/payer) reject | | `rejected` | `rejected` |
| A13. Adjudicate (in nhcx-preauth/payer) query | the case stays where it is; A5. Query Request (in nhcx-communication/payer) goes out | unchanged | `queried` |
| C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer) enhancement (lines added) | new lines pending, `enhancement_count` up one, the pre-auth slip reopened (`nhcx_correlation_id` replaced, `nhcx_answer_txn_id` cleared, `claim` back to `preauth` when no claim is filed) | `preauth` | `pending` |
| C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer) resubmission or C9. Communication (in nhcx-communication/payer) reply on a `queried` case | queried lines back to pending, documents filed, `nhcx_query_correlation_id` cleared | unchanged | `pending` |
| C5. Claim Submit (in nhcx-claim/payer) claim on a pre-authorised case | the bill replaced by the final one, discharge recorded when the case had none, the claim slip written | `claim` | `pending` |
| C7. Task Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer) cancel, or the desk's cancel | | `cancelled` | `cancelled` |
| C7. Task Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer) reprocess or release on a decided, unpaid claim (or the desk's reprocess) | every line back to pending, the wallet credited when the case was at `payment`, `reprocess_count` up one, `nhcx_claim_answer_txn_id` cleared, the reprocess slip written | `claim` | `pending` |
| [A14. Disburse](../apis/A14-disburse.md) a payment completes | `total_paid` up by the amount; `settled` when nothing approved is left | `settled` when paid in full | unchanged |

A reprocess of a paid case is refused (that is a recovery, not a reprocess); of an open case, refused ("only a decided case can be reprocessed").

**The routing slips** (the exchange origin; all null on a case entered by hand):

| Columns | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `nhcx_correlation_id`, `nhcx_sender_code`, `nhcx_recipient_code`, `nhcx_claim_ref` | C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer) on filing; `nhcx_correlation_id` and `nhcx_claim_ref` replaced by an enhancement or resubmission | A3. Pre-auth Answer (in nhcx-preauth/payer): the verdict goes back on `nhcx_correlation_id` to `nhcx_sender_code`; `nhcx_recipient_code` decides which payer code the case belongs to and which accounts see it |
| `nhcx_answer_txn_id` | A3. Pre-auth Answer (in nhcx-preauth/payer) when the pre-auth verdict goes out; cleared by an enhancement | A3. Pre-auth Answer (in nhcx-preauth/payer): set means the thread is answered and a second verdict is not sent |
| `nhcx_claim_correlation_id`, `nhcx_claim_submission_ref` | C5. Claim Submit (in nhcx-claim/payer) on filing | A4. Claim Answer (in nhcx-claim/payer): the claim verdict's thread and the number it names |
| `nhcx_claim_answer_txn_id` | A4. Claim Answer (in nhcx-claim/payer) or the reprocess answer; cleared by a reprocess | A4. Claim Answer (in nhcx-claim/payer): set means answered |
| `nhcx_query_correlation_id`, `nhcx_query_txn_id` | A5. Query Request (in nhcx-communication/payer) when the CommunicationRequest goes out (the gateway mints the id); cleared when the reply is filed | C9. Communication (in nhcx-communication/payer): the hospital's Communication is matched on it first |
| `nhcx_reprocess_correlation_id`, `nhcx_reprocess_claim_ref` (migration 0002) | C7. Task Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer) when a reprocess or release Task is taken in | A9. Task Answer (in nhcx-preauth/payer): the decision of a reopened claim goes back on this thread as a completed Task, because the claim's own thread was completed by the verdict being disputed and the exchange refuses a second answer on it; both cleared when it goes |

`scenario` pins a sandbox preset on the case, overriding what the member id implies (A19. Sandbox Scenarios (in nhcx-preauth/payer)) [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Totals.** `total_claimed` and `total_approved` are recomputed from [D25. case_line_item](D25-case-line-item.md) inside every transaction that changes a line; `total_paid` inside the one that completes a payment. The checks hold `total_approved <= total_claimed` and `total_paid <= total_approved`.

**Deleted:** never by the application. The sandbox's clear-data removes a sign-up account's cases with their children by cascade [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
