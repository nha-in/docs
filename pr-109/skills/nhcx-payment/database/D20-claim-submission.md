# D20. claim_submission

#### D20T. TABLE
One row is the claim leg of one claim episode: how the stay ended, the last claim send and the payer's verdict on it. Primary key `id`. Parent table: `claim` (D9), one row per claim.

#### D20D. DESCRIPTION
The claim carries everything the pre-authorisation did plus the discharge. It is a separate exchange from the pre-authorisation (D18), with its own thread, and it can go in after a pre-authorisation was queried.

**Created.** The first time the row is needed: saving the discharge or sending the claim on Claim Submission (S11) inserts `{claim_id, status: 'draft'}` if there is no row yet.

**Discharge.** "Save discharge" on S11 writes `discharge_mode`, `discharge_stage`, `discharge_date`, `surgery_date` and `death_date`. It is refused while `status` is `submitting`. Rules: the mode must be `normal`, `lama`, `dama` or `death`; the stage must be `Before Surgery`, `During Surgery` or `After Surgery` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); the discharge date is required and not before the admission date; a surgery date may not be before admission; `death` requires a date and time of death (a date alone is refused), and any other mode clears `death_date`. A row in `draft` or `error` goes (back) to `draft`; any other status is kept.

A `lama` or `dama` discharge at `Before Surgery` or `During Surgery` makes the claim quote the single procedure `LM100` instead of the pre-authorised lines (the payer disqualifies the rest) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). That is computed at send time from these two columns.

**Sending.** Allowed only with a discharge recorded and the pre-authorisation (D18) `approved` or `queried`. Each send writes `status` `submitting`, `txn_id`, `correlation_id`, `submitted_at`, `claim_ref` (the current claim number), `requested_amount` (the claim's lines total), `submission_kind`, `workflow_id`, `reply_text`, `request_json`, and clears `settled_at`, `error_message`, `outcome`, `disposition`, `approved_amount`, `eligible_amount`, `submitted_amount`, `items_json` and `response_json`. A query answer also keeps the question in `query_note` (the earlier `query_note`, else the earlier `disposition`).

**Which send it is** (`submission_kind`):

| Current row | Next send | Workflow id (PMJAY adapter; other adapters; see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) |
|---|---|---|
| none or `draft` | `claim` | 15; 15 |
| `queried` | `claim_query_response` (reply text required) | 161 [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); 151 |
| `rejected`, `partial` or `approved` | `claim_resubmit`, only where the adapter defines a workflow for it; PMJAY defines none and is told to ask for a reprocess instead [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | none; 16 |
| `error` | the same kind as the failed send (`claim_query_response` or `claim_resubmit`), else `claim` | |
| `submitting` | refused: "The claim is with the payer; wait for its answer before sending again." | |

**Statuses** (exact strings): `draft`, `submitting`, `approved`, `partial`, `queried`, `rejected`, `error`.

**The payer's reply** (C6, or polling when the claim is opened) is read exactly as for the pre-authorisation (D18 table) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers): outcome `queued` / `acknowledged` or reason `submitted` / `acknowledged` keeps `submitting`; reason `cancelled`, `rejected` or `denied`, or outcome `error`, is `rejected` (the `rejected` and `denied` reasons are a correction to the reference implementation, which read them as `queried`); reason `queried` is `queried`; `partial` with reason `approved` is `partial`; `complete` with reason `approved` or none is `approved`; anything else `queried`. It writes the flattened reply, `api_call_id`, `settled_at` (for a decision), `response_json`, clears `error_message` and copies `correlation_id` into `thread_correlation_id`. A redelivery (same `x-hcx-api_call_id`, or with none, the same outcome and adjudication) is ignored.

**Refusals.** A ProtocolResponse, a peer or protocol error found by polling, a failed dispatch or a failed send sets `status` `error` with the message. A refused `claim_query_response` instead goes back to `queried` with the question restored into `disposition`, so the desk answers again. `correlation_id` is put back to `thread_correlation_id` when there is one. A ledger 404 sets `error`.

**Reprocess and release.** When the payer accepts a reprocess or balance release Task (D29, C8), this row goes back to `submitting` with `settled_at` and `error_message` cleared: the new verdict comes on the claim's own thread.

**Revival.** A row on record as a failed send goes back to `submitting` when the payer answers on its thread.

**Deleted.** Never by the application; by cascade with the claim or when the transactional store is cleared. Every change also recomputes the claim's `stage` and `sub_stage` (D9).
