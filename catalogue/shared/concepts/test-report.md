title: Turn a completed test run into the final test report
summary: >
  When every mandatory case in NHA's workbook is PASS for a run type, a script
  reads the workbook and the run's screenshots and writes the test report NHA
  asks for, as a Word document with a cover, a contents field and fourteen
  fixed sections, each case's evidence in one fixed table with its REQUEST-IDs,
  Aadhaar, ABHA and mobile numbers masked and no credential, token or OTP in it.

      NHA's request of 22 October 2026: run the cases in its workbook, write
      the results into the same sheet, and produce the final test report from
      the run. The report structure is the common ground of the empanelled
      agencies' M1 to M3 functional testing reports NHA sent with it.

# Turn a completed test run into the final test report

## In plain words

A functional test run ends with NHA's workbook filled in, one row per case.
The test report is the document a reviewer signs off: who tested what, when,
with which tools, the status of every case, and the evidence for each one. It
is built from the workbook, not written by hand, so the report and the sheet
always agree.

The report is written only when the run has passed. Its gate is every
mandatory case that applies to your entity type, government or private, with
status `PASS` in the run type's column. A mandatory case that is `FAIL` or
blank stops it, and so does one that is `NA` unless NHA agreed it is not run.

| Run type | Report | Evidence per case |
|---|---|---|
| `ui` | The exit report NHA asks for | The screenshots under `abdm-ft/evidence/<case id>/` |
| `ft` | The same structure | The `FT Response with Code` value in place of screenshots |

The report is a Word document. Every page carries the report title in its
header and `Confidential, page N of M` in its footer. Its parts come in this
order, each from a fixed source, so two reports for the same milestone read
the same way.

| Part | What it holds | Comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Cover | Title, product, organisation, milestone, run type, document id, version, release date, a confidentiality line | `meta.json`, `--run` |
| Contents | A Word contents field over every section and every case id, which Word fills in on opening | The headings below |
| 1. Document control | Document title, id, version, prepared, reviewed, approved and released by, release date; change history; distribution list by name, organisation and role | `meta.json` `document` |
| 2. Executive summary | The run in one paragraph: cases, PASS, FAIL, NA, no result, whether every mandatory case holds, how many took more than one pass | The workbook's counts |
| 3. ABDM details | Entity, product, category, role, entity type, milestone, API version, run type, dates, days, most passes any case took, executed by, recordings | `meta.json`, the workbook |
| 4. Results summary | A counts table, a table by the workbook's Function column, and one row per case with marking, status and iterations; any mandatory case NHA agreed is not run, with the agreement | The workbook, `agreed_not_run` |
| 5. Scope and limitations | Applications and URLs; role, entity type, run type, workbook, tabs, cases; optional cases not passed; the limitation that results hold for the build tested on those dates, and any `limitations` | `meta.json`, the workbook |
| 6. Flow details | For linking and consent flows: the ABHA address used and the HI types created or tested | `meta.json` `flows` |
| 7. Test environment and tools | Browser, Playwright, PHR app, emulator, the model that ran the agent, with versions | `meta.json` `environment` |
| 8. Test team | Name, role and qualifications of each tester, reviewer and approver | `meta.json` `team` |
| 9. Approach and methodology | How the agent ran cases, the three pass limit, how OTPs and consents were given, the run type, REQUEST-IDs, and what PASS, FAIL, NA and no result mean | Fixed text, `--run` |
| 10. Test data | The ABHA numbers and addresses used, masked | `meta.json` `test_data` |
| 11. Evidence | Per case, a heading with its id and title, then one table of test case ID, title, marking, expected result, observed, status, iterations, failure reason with any error code, and request ids; then the response with its code; then each screenshot with a numbered caption naming the case and step | The workbook, `findings`, `--manifest`, the evidence folder |
| 12. Failures and iterations log | Every case not PASS or that took more than one pass, with its failure reason and error code | The workbook |
| 13. Conclusion and sign-off | The result in one paragraph, then a sign-off table for preparer, reviewer and approver with date and signature | The counts, `meta.json` `document` |
| 14. Annexures | Recording links, the completed workbook, the REQUEST-ID manifest, the evidence folder | `meta.json`, the arguments |

The only prose you write is the one line finding per case, in `meta.json`.
The observed value is that finding, else the Remarks value; the response
with its code follows the table. A failure reason is the Remarks value, else the response,
with any `ABDM-` or `MIS-` code, HTTP 4xx or 5xx status or exception named in them. Request
ids come from the run's manifest JSON, the file the test skill writes beside
the run log, given with `--manifest`. A request id that is a UUID is printed as
it is, so a reviewer can look it up in the gateway's record; anything else in
that field is masked like the rest of the report.

What the report never holds: a login, password, client secret, token or OTP,
an unmasked Aadhaar number, ABHA number or mobile, and anyone's email or phone
number. The team and distribution tables take a name, a role and an
organisation only.

How the marking column is read. It is the first column whose name holds both
`Mandatory` and `Optional`, in any case and spacing: `Mandatory/ Optional` on
the HMIS and HPR sheets, `Optional / Mandatory` on the PHR sheet.

| Marking in the sheet | Government entity | Private entity |
|---|---|---|
| `Mandatory`, `Yes` | Mandatory | Mandatory |
| `Mandatory` then a list of mandatory and optional fields, as on PHR's profile cases | Mandatory | Mandatory |
| `No`, `Optional`, `Non-Mandatory` | Optional | Optional |
| `Mandatory for Private` | Optional | Mandatory |
| `Mandatory for Government` | Mandatory | Optional |
| `Mandatory for Private /Government (Optional only if ...)` | Mandatory, flagged conditional | Mandatory, flagged conditional |
| `Either of the test cases X or Y is mandatory for Government` | X or Y must pass; one passing satisfies both | The row carrying it is optional; the other case keeps its own marking |
| `Yes (if ...)`, `Yes, if ...`, `Yes(only if ...)` | Mandatory, flagged conditional | Mandatory, flagged conditional |
| Blank | Mandatory, flagged not marked | Mandatory, flagged not marked |
| Anything else, such as a note in the marking cell | Mandatory, flagged unrecognised | Mandatory, flagged unrecognised |

A mandatory case can have no meaning in a run type, such as a screen only case
in an `ft` run, or be a conditional case your system does not offer. Record it
`not-run` only after NHA agrees it does not apply, and say so in its remarks.
Then add it to `agreed_not_run` in `meta.json`, with who at NHA agreed and
when: `"agreed_not_run": {"<case id>": "<who at NHA agreed, and when>"}`. The gate passes a mandatory `NA` case only when it is listed there, and
the report lists every such case with its agreement in the results summary and
in the failures and iterations log. An unlisted mandatory `NA` still blocks.
The check also prints every case it treated as conditional, so the person
signing off sees them.

## Before you start

- The workbook the run wrote into, with its results, as `shared.concept.test-workbook-write-back` leaves it.
- For a `ui` report, the screenshots under `abdm-ft/evidence/<case id>/`, one folder per case id as `cases` prints it. They are placed in name order, so name them `01-consent.png`, `02-otp.png`. Blur any Aadhaar number, OTP or full mobile on a screenshot before it goes in the folder: the script masks text, not images.
- Python 3.9 or later with `openpyxl`, `Pillow` and `python-docx`: `pip install openpyxl pillow python-docx`. All three are open source (MIT, the HPND licence and MIT).
- LibreOffice, if you want a PDF beside the Word file. Without it, export the PDF from Word or LibreOffice yourself.
- The script below, saved as `abdm-ft/abdm_report.py`.
- A `meta.json` for the report, written by you, with placeholder values replaced. It carries no credential: the script refuses any field named like `password`, `secret`, `token` or `credentials`, and any value that holds a token or a credential's label with its value, such as `client secret: ...`. `agreed_not_run` is only for mandatory cases NHA agreed are not run; leave it `{}` otherwise. `flows` is for M2 and M3 linking and consent flows; leave it `[]` for M1. `team` and `distribution` carry no email or phone number.
- For request ids in the report, the run's manifest JSON, which the test skill writes beside the run log at the end of the run. It is optional: without it each case reads `No manifest given`. The script refuses a manifest that holds a credential, as it does `meta.json`.

## What happens

1. When the last case is recorded and written into the workbook, run the gate for the run type and your entity type:

   ```bash
   python3 abdm-ft/abdm_report.py check <workbook> --run ui --entity private --meta abdm-ft/meta.json
   ```

   `--meta` is optional for `check`: it is read for `agreed_not_run`. The script prints one `marking` line for every case whose marking is entity specific, conditional, an either rule, a field list, blank or unrecognised, with how it was treated, and one `agreed not run <id>: <agreement>` line per mandatory `NA` case `agreed_not_run` lets through. Then one `not passed <id>: <status>` line per mandatory case in the way, an either pair as `<id> or <id>: <status>, <status>`, and a count.

2. If it exits `1`, the run is not finished. Rerun the cases it lists, as `open` in `shared.concept.test-workbook-write-back` does, and run `check` again. Do not run `build`.

3. Only when `check` exits `0`, write the one line findings into `meta.json` under `findings`, keyed by case id. A case without one gets its Remarks value. Then build:

   ```bash
   python3 abdm-ft/abdm_report.py build <workbook> --run ui --meta abdm-ft/meta.json --evidence abdm-ft/evidence --manifest abdm-ft/m1-<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.json --out abdm-ft/report-m1.docx
   ```

   `entity_type` in `meta.json` is the entity type, unless `--entity` is given. `build` runs the gate again and refuses with the same list if it fails. `--manifest` is optional.

4. Open the report in Word or LibreOffice and accept the prompt to update fields. That fills in the contents and the page count. A screenshot that needs a highlight box gets it before it goes in the evidence folder.

5. For an `ft` report, use `--run ft` in both commands. The evidence for each case is its `FT Response with Code` value, and `--evidence` is not read.

6. With `soffice` on PATH, `build` also writes `report-m1.pdf`. Otherwise it prints that the PDF can be exported from Word or LibreOffice.

## How you know it worked

- `check` exits `0` and its last line reads `0 of <n> mandatory case(s) for a <entity> entity not PASS in the <run> run`.
- `build` prints `wrote abdm-ft/report-m1.docx` and exits `0`.
- The document opens with the cover and the contents, then the fourteen headings from Document control to Annexures, in order. Every page has the report title at the top and `Confidential, page N of M` at the bottom.
- The results summary has one row per case in the workbook. Each case's evidence section starts with its nine row table, then its response, then its screenshots in name order, each captioned `Figure <n>: <case id>, step <k> (<file>)`.
- With `--manifest`, each case's Request IDs row lists the REQUEST-IDs the manifest gives it, or reads `None in the manifest`.
- No 12 digit number appears anywhere in it: an Aadhaar number reads `XXXX XXXX 1234` and an ABHA number `XX-XXXX-XXXX-1234`, with the last four digits kept. A 10 digit mobile reads `XXXXXX1234`.
- No token or secret appears in it: a JWT reads `[token]`, and a value after a label naming a password, secret, token, OTP, credential, API key or private key reads `[redacted]`. This covers the workbook's Response and Remarks values and the findings, as well as `meta.json`.

## When it goes wrong

| Observed | Cause | Do |
|---|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'docx'` | python-docx is not installed | `pip install openpyxl pillow python-docx` |
| `not passed CRT_ABHA_105: FAIL` | A mandatory case failed | Fix the cause the Remarks name, rerun the case, write it back, run `check` again |
| `not passed <id>: NA` | A mandatory case was recorded not run, and `agreed_not_run` does not list it | Run it, or agree with NHA that it does not apply, keep the reason in its remarks, and add it to `agreed_not_run` with who agreed and when. Pass `--meta` to `check` |
| `agreed_not_run must map each case id` | An entry has no agreement text | Write who at NHA agreed and when for every case listed |
| `not passed <id>: blank` | The case needs a tester step, or never ran | Finish it with the tester, then write it back |
| `marking <id> "...": unrecognised marking: treated as mandatory`, or `no marking` | NHA used a marking the script does not know, such as PHR's note on row P1 3.6, or left it blank | Ask NHA what it means for your entity type. Never edit NHA's marking to pass the gate |
| `meta.json carries a credential` | `meta.json` has a password, secret, token or credentials field, or a value holding a JWT or a credential's label with its value | Delete the field or the value. A report never carries a credential |
| `the workbook has a (run) column but no .before-abdm-run copy` | The writer's copy of NHA's workbook was moved or deleted | Put it back beside the workbook. Without it the script cannot tell NHA's text from the run's |
| `case id on more than one tab` | Two tabs carry the same id | Ask NHA which one counts |
| `no Test Case ID column with ids` | The workbook has no case ids, as NHA's PHR workbook does not, and no write has added them yet | Write the run's results with `shared.concept.test-workbook-write-back` first: its first write adds the `Test Case ID` column |
| `the manifest carries a credential` | The manifest JSON holds a token, secret or password field or value | Write the manifest as the test skill does, case ids to request ids and nothing else |
| The contents page reads `Open in Word and update fields` | The fields have not been updated since the script wrote them | Open the file in Word or LibreOffice and update fields, then save |
| A screenshot is missing from the report | Its file is not under `<evidence>/<case id>/`, or its extension is not png, jpg, gif or bmp | Move it into the case's folder, named as `cases` prints the id, and build again |
