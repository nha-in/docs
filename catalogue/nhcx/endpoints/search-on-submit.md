# POST /v1/search/on_submit

## In plain words

This answers a search. As a payer, you return the claim documents for the case the search named, sealed, through [NHCX](../../shared/glossary/nhcx.md). The bundle is a Task whose `Task.output` references the `ClaimResponse` for that case. Nothing about the claim changes.

You call it after you have received a [`/v1/search/submit`](search-submit.md).

## Before you start

- A session token that has not expired. See [the session token](../concepts/session-token.md).
- The `/v1/search/submit` you are answering, received on [your registered address](../callbacks/search-submit.md), decrypted, and acknowledged with 202 within 30 seconds.
- That request's `x-hcx-correlation_id` and `x-hcx-sender_code`, stored. You echo the first and address the answer to the second.
- The encryption certificate of the requester, fetched with [`/fetch/certs`](fetch-certs.md).
- A Task bundle with `Task.status` `completed`, the `ClaimResponse` as a bundle entry, and `Task.output` referencing it.
- A handler for [`/v1/error`](../callbacks/error.md), where NHCX reports an answer it could not deliver.

## What happens

Your system, as the payer or a TPA acting for it, answers a request it received ([receiving the request](../callbacks/search-submit.md)) by calling NHCX on `/v1/search/on_submit`. NHCX answers 202 at once and delivers the same path to the registered address of the requester ([receiving `/v1/search/on_submit`](../callbacks/search-on-submit.md)).

### 1. Seal the answer

Swap the sender and recipient codes of the request. Echo its correlation id. Put these values in the [JWE](../glossary/jwe.md) [protected header](../glossary/protected-header.md):

```json
{
  "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256",
  "enc": "A256GCM",
  "x-hcx-sender_code": "<YOUR_PARTICIPANT_CODE>",
  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<REQUESTER_PARTICIPANT_CODE_FROM_THE_REQUEST>",
  "x-hcx-api_call_id": "<NEW_UUID_FOR_THIS_CALL>",
  "x-hcx-request_id": "<REQUEST_UUID>",
  "x-hcx-correlation_id": "<CORRELATION_ID_OF_THE_REQUEST>",
  "x-hcx-timestamp": "<CURRENT_TIMESTAMP>",
  "x-hcx-status": "response.complete",
  "x-hcx-ben-abha-id": "<BENEFICIARY_ABHA_NUMBER>"
}
```

Send `response.complete`, or `response.partial` when more results follow. The `x-hcx-*` values ride inside the JWE [protected header](../glossary/protected-header.md), not as HTTP headers. [The protocol headers](../concepts/protocol-headers.md) explains each one, including the timestamp format.

### 2. Send it

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/hcx/v1/search/on_submit' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSION_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSION_TOKEN>' \
  --data-raw '{
    "type": "JWEPayload",
    "payload": "<JWE_COMPACT_STRING>"
  }'
```

Send the token on both `bearer_auth` and `Authorization`, with the same value and the word `Bearer` in front. `<JWE_COMPACT_STRING>` is your sealed message: five base64url parts joined by dots. See [the JWE envelope](../concepts/jwe-envelope.md).

### 3. Refusing a request

To refuse the request at protocol level instead, send `"type": "ProtocolResponse"` on this path with `x-hcx-status` `response.error` and `x-hcx-error_details` holding `code`, `message` and `trace`. Keep clinical and business reasons inside the sealed payload. Only protocol errors go in the header.

### 4. Retrying

**Idempotency.** Echo the `x-hcx-correlation_id` of the request you are answering. A correlation id NHCX does not hold, or one it has already deleted, is refused with [`NHCX-1010`](../errors/nhcx-1010.md). Generate a new `x-hcx-api_call_id` for every call. `/v1/status` looks a message up by that value ([`NHCX-1012`](../errors/nhcx-1012.md) when it cannot), so never reuse one.

## How you know it worked

You receive HTTP `202 Accepted` with this body:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "<DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss:sss>",
  "api_call_id": "<YOUR_API_CALL_ID>",
  "correlation_id": "<YOUR_CORRELATION_ID>",
  "result": {
    "sender_code": "<YOUR_PARTICIPANT_CODE>",
    "recipient_code": "<REQUESTER_PARTICIPANT_CODE_FROM_THE_REQUEST>",
    "entity_type": "task",
    "protocol_status": "request.dispatched"
  },
  "error": {
    "code": "",
    "message": ""
  }
}
```

- `correlation_id` matches the request you answered, and `api_call_id` matches the value you sealed.
- `result.entity_type` is `task`.
- `error.code` and `error.message` are empty.

NHCX then delivers your answer to the requester. The recipient must answer each delivery with 202 and the acknowledgement body within 30 seconds. Otherwise NHCX retries up to five times, then deletes the request and reports it on the sender's [`/v1/error`](../callbacks/error.md). The step is done when you hold the 202 and no report for this correlation id arrives on your `/v1/error`.

## When it goes wrong

- [`NHCX-1010`](../errors/nhcx-1010.md): NHCX holds no request with that correlation id. You minted a new one instead of echoing it, or the request was deleted after failed deliveries.
- [`NHCX-1011`](../errors/nhcx-1011.md): `x-hcx-status` is not `response.complete`, `response.partial` or `response.error`.
- [`PAYR-1517`](../errors/payr-1517.md): a refusal arrived as a `JWEPayload`. Protocol refusals travel as `ProtocolResponse`.
- `401 Unauthorized`, or [`NHCX-401`](../errors/nhcx-401.md): get a new session token and send again.
- A report arrives on your [`/v1/error`](../callbacks/error.md): the requester's address did not acknowledge five deliveries. The request is dead on that correlation id.
