# POST /v1/predetermination/submit

## In plain words

Predetermination asks the insurer for an estimate: what it would approve for a proposed treatment. Your system, as the provider, sends a bundle shaped like a pre-authorisation, with `Claim.use` `predetermination`, to [NHCX](../../shared/glossary/nhcx.md). The payer's estimate arrives later on your `/v1/predetermination/on_submit`.

An estimate reserves nothing. The treatment still needs a pre-authorisation when it happens. Build this only with a payer that has confirmed it answers predetermination.

## Before you start

- A session token that has not expired. See [the session token](../concepts/session-token.md) and [how to get one](session-token.md).
- Your own [participant code](../glossary/participant-code.md), with your callback address registered, reachable from NHCX and answering 202 within 30 seconds. See [callback URL rules](../sandbox/callback-url-requirements.md).
- The payer's participant code, for a payer that has confirmed it supports predetermination.
- The recipient's encryption certificate, fetched with [`/fetch/certs`](fetch-certs.md). You seal the message with its public key.
- A bundle shaped as in [the preauthorisation request bundle](../fhir/preauth-request.md), with `Claim.use` `predetermination` and your predetermination reference in `Claim.identifier[0].value`.
- A handler for [`/v1/error`](../callbacks/error.md), so a request NHCX cannot deliver does not look like one still under review.
- A handler for [`/v1/predetermination/on_submit`](../callbacks/predetermination-on-submit.md).

## What happens

Your system, as the provider, calls NHCX on `/v1/predetermination/submit`. NHCX checks the envelope, answers 202 at once, and forwards the same path to the payer's registered address ([receiving `/v1/predetermination/submit`](../callbacks/predetermination-submit.md)). The payer answers later on [`/v1/predetermination/on_submit`](../callbacks/predetermination-on-submit.md), which NHCX delivers to you.

### 1. Seal the message

Put these values in the [JWE](../glossary/jwe.md) [protected header](../glossary/protected-header.md) and encrypt the bundle with the recipient's public key.

```json
{
  "alg": "RSA-OAEP-256",
  "enc": "A256GCM",
  "x-hcx-sender_code": "<YOUR_PARTICIPANT_CODE>",
  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<PAYER_PARTICIPANT_CODE>",
  "x-hcx-api_call_id": "<NEW_UUID_FOR_THIS_CALL>",
  "x-hcx-request_id": "<REQUEST_UUID>",
  "x-hcx-correlation_id": "<CORRELATION_UUID>",
  "x-hcx-timestamp": "<CURRENT_TIMESTAMP>",
  "x-hcx-status": "request.initiated",
  "x-hcx-ben-abha-id": "<BENEFICIARY_ABHA_NUMBER>"
}
```

The `x-hcx-*` values ride inside the JWE [protected header](../glossary/protected-header.md), not as HTTP headers. [The protocol headers](../concepts/protocol-headers.md) explains each one, including the timestamp format. Give each predetermination a new correlation id. No workflow code applies.

### 2. Send it

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/hcx/v1/predetermination/submit' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSION_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSION_TOKEN>' \
  --data-raw '{
    "payload": "<JWE_COMPACT_STRING>"
  }'
```

Send the token on both `bearer_auth` and `Authorization`, with the same value and the word `Bearer` in front. `<JWE_COMPACT_STRING>` is your sealed message: five base64url parts joined by dots. See [the JWE envelope](../concepts/jwe-envelope.md).

### 3. Retrying

**Idempotency.** NHCX keys every conversation on `x-hcx-correlation_id`. An initiating request that reuses a correlation id NHCX already holds is refused with [`NHCX-1006`](../errors/nhcx-1006.md). So a blind retry is not safe. If your call timed out, ask [`/v1/status`](status.md) before you resend. `/v1/status` finds a message by its `x-hcx-api_call_id` ([`NHCX-1012`](../errors/nhcx-1012.md) when it cannot), so generate a new one for every call, a retry included. After a request fails for good, NHCX makes its correlation id inactive. Start a new cycle with a new correlation id.

## How you know it worked

You receive HTTP `202 Accepted` with the acknowledgement body: `timestamp`, `api_call_id`, `correlation_id`, `result` and an empty `error`.

- `correlation_id` and `api_call_id` match the values you sealed.
- `error.code` and `error.message` are empty.

The step is done when [`/v1/predetermination/on_submit`](../callbacks/predetermination-on-submit.md) reaches your callback address with the same `x-hcx-correlation_id`. It carries a `ClaimResponse` with `use` `predetermination` and the estimated benefit in `ClaimResponse.total` under category `benefit`. Your handler answers it 202 within 30 seconds.

## When it goes wrong

- `401 Unauthorized`, or [`NHCX-401`](../errors/nhcx-401.md): the session token expired or lacks the `Bearer ` prefix. Get a new token and send again. See [every call returns 401](../troubleshooting/everything-returns-401.md).
- [`NHCX-1003`](../errors/nhcx-1003.md): the recipient code is not registered. A provider used `PayerID` instead of `processingID`.
- [`NHCX-1006`](../errors/nhcx-1006.md): the correlation id was used before. Start the cycle with a new one.
- [`NHCX-1011`](../errors/nhcx-1011.md): `x-hcx-status` is not `request.initiated`.
- You got 202 and nothing more arrives. The recipient may have failed to decrypt ([`PAYR-1001`](../errors/payr-1001.md)) or your callback is unreachable. See [accepted, then no callback](../troubleshooting/accepted-then-no-callback.md).
