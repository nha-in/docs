# Verify the OTP for a profile change

## In plain words

Completes the change the OTP was raised for. Send the same `scope` you
used when requesting it, along with the `txnId` and the encrypted OTP.

## Before you start

- A gateway access token. See [the gateway session](../concepts/gateway-session.md).
- The person logged in, so you hold their `X-token`. See [log somebody in](../flows/m1-login-by-mobile.md).

## What happens

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://abhasbx.abdm.gov.in/abha/api/v3/profile/account/verify' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'REQUEST-ID: <FRESH_UUID>' \
  -H 'TIMESTAMP: <ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP>' \
  -H 'X-token: <X_TOKEN_FROM_LOGIN_VERIFY>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "scope": [
    "abha-profile",
    "mobile-verify"
  ],
  "authData": {
    "authMethods": [
      "otp"
    ],
    "otp": {
      "txnId": "<TXN_ID>",
      "otpValue": "<OTPVALUE>"
    }
  }
}'
```

Every placeholder in angle brackets is something you supply. `REQUEST-ID` is a UUID you generate for this call and log before sending.

Idempotency: not established. NHA does not document whether repeating this call with the same body is safe, and it has not been tested here. Treat a retry after a timeout as potentially creating a second effect until that is proven.

## How you know it worked

The response body for this operation is not yet published.

## When it goes wrong

- The clock is wrong and every call fails. See [ABDM-2402](../errors/abdm-2402.md).
- The `REQUEST-ID` is missing, malformed or reused. See [ABDM-2404](../errors/abdm-2404.md).
- No session token was sent. See [ABDM-2500](../errors/abdm-2500.md).
- The person scoped token is wrong or expired. See [ABDM-2401](../errors/abdm-2401.md).
- Authentication fails without saying why. See [900900](../errors/900900.md).
- ABDM fails and does not say why. See [ABDM-9999](../errors/abdm-9999.md).
