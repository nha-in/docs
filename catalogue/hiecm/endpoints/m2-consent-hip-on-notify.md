# Consent HIP On-Notify, Acknowledge consent notification

## In plain words

**Async Callback:** After ABDM Gateway sends a consent grant notification to the HIP bridge URL
(`{bridgeUrl}/v0.5/consents/hip/notify`), the HIP calls this Gateway endpoint to
acknowledge receipt of the consent artefact.

The consent notification contains the full consent details including care contexts,
HI types, date range, and digital signature for validation.

This wording is NHA's own, from the file this operation was ingested from.

## Before you start

- A gateway access token. See [the gateway session](../concepts/gateway-session.md).
- The right `X-CM-ID` for the environment you are calling.

## What happens

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://dev.abdm.gov.in/api/hiecm/consent/v3/request/hip/on-notify' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'REQUEST-ID: <FRESH_UUID>' \
  -H 'TIMESTAMP: <ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP>' \
  -H 'X-CM-ID: sbx' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '<REQUEST_BODY>'
```

The request and response schemas for this operation are in `catalogue/openapi/hiecm/v3/hiecm-m2.yaml`, ingested from NHA's file.

NHA calls this operation `consentHipOnNotify`.

## How you know it worked

Not yet observed, and NHA's file documents no response body for this operation. Run it against the sandbox and record what comes back before relying on it.

## When it goes wrong

- The clock is wrong and every call fails. See [ABDM-2402](../errors/abdm-2402.md).
- The `REQUEST-ID` is missing, malformed or reused. See [ABDM-2404](../errors/abdm-2404.md).
- No session token was sent. See [ABDM-2500](../errors/abdm-2500.md).
- ABDM fails and does not say why. See [ABDM-9999](../errors/abdm-9999.md).
