# Submit a captured biometric or face authentication block

## In plain words

Hands NHA the PID block produced by the Aadhaar RD service. The block is
encrypted by the device and is time limited, so send it as soon as the
capture returns rather than storing it.

## Before you start

- A gateway access token. See [the gateway session](../concepts/gateway-session.md).
- A `txnId` from the previous call in the flow. It is not reusable across attempts.

## What happens

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://abhasbx.abdm.gov.in/abha/api/v3/enrollment/enrol/capturePID' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'REQUEST-ID: <FRESH_UUID>' \
  -H 'TIMESTAMP: <ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "scope": [
    "abha-enrol",
    "face-verify"
  ],
  "txnId": "<TXN_ID>"
}'
```

Every placeholder in angle brackets is something you supply. `REQUEST-ID` is a UUID you generate for this call and log before sending.

Idempotency: not established. NHA does not document whether repeating this call with the same body is safe, and it has not been tested here. Treat a retry after a timeout as potentially creating a second effect until that is proven.

## How you know it worked

NHA's own collection records responses for this operation at status 200, and those bodies are in the specification as examples with the personal data scrubbed.

Read the body rather than only the status. Several of NHA's saved failures return a body that names the problem while the status alone does not.

This has not been run against the sandbox from this repository. When you run it, record the response here and set `verified.status` accordingly.

## When it goes wrong

- The clock is wrong and every call fails. See [ABDM-2402](../errors/abdm-2402.md).
- The `REQUEST-ID` is missing, malformed or reused. See [ABDM-2404](../errors/abdm-2404.md).
- No session token was sent. See [ABDM-2500](../errors/abdm-2500.md).
- ABDM fails and does not say why. See [ABDM-9999](../errors/abdm-9999.md).
