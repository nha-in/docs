# Consent HIU On-Notify, Acknowledge consent notification

## In plain words

**Async Callback:** After ABDM Gateway sends a consent grant/deny notification to the HIU
bridge URL (`{bridgeUrl}/v0.5/consents/hiu/notify`), the HIU calls this Gateway endpoint
to acknowledge receipt.

The Gateway sends this notification when:
- Patient grants the consent
- Patient denies the consent
- A previously granted consent is revoked

This wording is NHA's own, from the file this operation was ingested from.

## Before you start

- A gateway access token. See [the gateway session](../concepts/gateway-session.md).
- The right `X-CM-ID` for the environment you are calling.

## What happens

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://dev.abdm.gov.in/api/hiecm/consent/v3/request/hiu/on-notify' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'REQUEST-ID: <FRESH_UUID>' \
  -H 'TIMESTAMP: <ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP>' \
  -H 'X-CM-ID: sbx' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '<REQUEST_BODY>'
```

The request and response schemas for this operation are in `catalogue/openapi/hiecm/v3/hiecm-m3.yaml`, ingested from NHA's file.

NHA calls this operation `consentHiuOnNotify`.

## How you know it worked

Not yet observed, and NHA's file documents no response body for this operation. Run it against the sandbox and record what comes back before relying on it.

## When it goes wrong

- The clock is wrong and every call fails. See [ABDM-2402](../errors/abdm-2402.md).
- The `REQUEST-ID` is missing, malformed or reused. See [ABDM-2404](../errors/abdm-2404.md).
- No session token was sent. See [ABDM-2500](../errors/abdm-2500.md).
- ABDM fails and does not say why. See [ABDM-9999](../errors/abdm-9999.md).
