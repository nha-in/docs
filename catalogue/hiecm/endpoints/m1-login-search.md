# Search ABHA Profile (for Password Login)

## In plain words

Look up a profile by ABHA Number as the first step of the password login flow.
Returns basic profile info to confirm the correct account before requesting password.

This wording is NHA's own, from the file this operation was ingested from.

## Before you start

- A gateway access token. See [the gateway session](../concepts/gateway-session.md).
- The right `X-CM-ID` for the environment you are calling.

## What happens

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://abhasbx.abdm.gov.in/abha/api/v3/profile/login/search' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'REQUEST-ID: <FRESH_UUID>' \
  -H 'TIMESTAMP: <ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP>' \
  -H 'X-CM-ID: sbx' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '<REQUEST_BODY>'
```

The request and response schemas for this operation are in `catalogue/openapi/hiecm/v3/hiecm-m1.yaml`, ingested from NHA's file.

NHA calls this operation `loginSearch`.

## How you know it worked

NHA's file documents a response schema for this operation. Read it in `hiecm-m1.yaml` rather than assuming a shape.

It has not been run against the sandbox from this repository, so the schema is what NHA says, not what was observed. When you run it, record the real response here and set `verified.status`.

## When it goes wrong

- The clock is wrong and every call fails. See [ABDM-2402](../errors/abdm-2402.md).
- The `REQUEST-ID` is missing, malformed or reused. See [ABDM-2404](../errors/abdm-2404.md).
- No session token was sent. See [ABDM-2500](../errors/abdm-2500.md).
- ABDM fails and does not say why. See [ABDM-9999](../errors/abdm-9999.md).
