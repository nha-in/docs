# L3. Integration Planning

#### L3G. GOAL
Turn discovery and mapping into an ordered integration plan for this target: phases, steps and sub-steps, each saying what changes in the target, which spec items it delivers, and what it depends on.

#### L3I. INPUTS
- `nhcx-plan/discovery.json`, `nhcx-plan/mapping.json`.
- The flow in [screens/INDEX.md](../screens/INDEX.md) and the API and callback indexes.

### L3.1 Fix the order
Build in the order a claim happens, so each phase can be exercised on its own. These are the phases of [references/SCAFFOLDING.md](../references/SCAFFOLDING.md) section 12:
1. Foundation: gateway embedded (G1 to G11), configuration, ledger, the inbound route and the C1 dispatcher.
2. Data: new tables and columns from mapping.json (D), master-data fixes (ABHA, HPR, HFR, participant codes).
3. Policy and eligibility: S1, S2, S3, S5, S6 shell; A1, A2; C2; F2, F3, F15 to F18.
4. Plan and line items: S7, S8; A3, A2 (auth-requirements); C3, C4; F4 to F6.
5. Pre-authorisation: S4, S9; A4, A6 (cancel, status); C5, C7, C8; F7, F8, F9, F10.
6. Payer communication: S10; A7; C9; F11, F12.
7. Claim: S11; A5, A6 (reprocess, release); C6, C8.
8. Payment: S12; A8; C10; F13, F14.
9. Patient and practitioner screens where the target lacks fields: S13 to S16.
10. Navigation: add "Claims" to the HMIS home screen or sidebar.

### L3.2 Describe each step for this target
For every step: what is added or changed in the target (by module and file, using discovery.json locations), which spec ids it delivers, which mapping entries it resolves, and the target-specific decisions (for example "extend the existing `insurance_policy` table instead of adding D9 policy columns").

### L3.3 Record dependencies and risks
Dependencies between steps (by id), external needs (participant code, client id and secret, private key and registered certificate, public URL reachable by NHCX), and risks with a mitigation.

Take the production cutover and the deployment shape (one NHCX instance, its own ledger directory) from [OPERATIONS.md](../references/OPERATIONS.md): each cutover step becomes a plan step with an owner, and a target that cannot give one instance the NHCX role records that as a risk.

### L3.4 Define done per phase
For each phase, the observable check that shows it works (for example "S3 shows `eligible` after C2 settles a verdict for a sandbox policy").

#### L3O. OUTPUT
`nhcx-plan/plan.json`:

```json
{
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "P3",
      "title": "Policy and eligibility",
      "done_when": "",
      "steps": [
        {
          "id": "P3.1",
          "title": "",
          "description": "specific to the target",
          "delivers": ["S1", "A1", "G10"],
          "resolves": ["D9.member_id"],
          "changes": [{"file": "", "lines": "", "change": "add | modify"}],
          "depends_on": ["P1.2"],
          "substeps": [{"id": "P3.1.1", "title": "", "description": ""}]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "external": [{"need": "participant code", "owner": "", "status": "have | requested | missing"}],
  "risks": [{"risk": "", "mitigation": ""}],
  "corrections": []
}
```

#### L3L. LOG
Record in `nhcx-plan/progress.json` and regenerate `nhcx-plan/progress.md`, as [LOG.md](LOG.md) describes. One entry per sub-step. L3.2 logs one entry per plan step it describes (the P id as `item`), and every write to `nhcx-plan/plan.json`.

#### L3X. EXIT
- Every spec id marked `missing` or `partial` in discovery.json is delivered by exactly one step.
- Every `missing` or `conflict` mapping entry is resolved by a step.
- The dependency graph has no cycles, and every phase has a `done_when`.
- Every sub-step of L3 has its `started` and closing entries in progress.json, and every file changed is named in one.
