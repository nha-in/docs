# NHCX Use Cases

A use case covers each stage of the claims lifecycle: onboarding providers and payers onto the network, verifying coverage, seeking preauthorisation, submitting claims, exchanging supporting information, and reconciling payments. Between them they deliver the core objectives of standardisation, traceability, and predictable auto-adjudication across India's National Health Claims Exchange (NHCX).

## Key Use Cases Overview

- **Onboarding Providers and Payers**: Onboard participants onto NHCX to validate and route requests to target applications.
- **Check Coverage Eligibility**: Called by providers to verify beneficiary coverage, policy validity, sum insured, sub-limits, and document requirements.
- **Preauth Request Submission**: Submitted by providers before admission or planned surgery. Payers respond with line-item adjudication via `on_submit`.
- **Predetermination Request**: Inquires expected coverage and deductible calculations for planned procedures without reserving policy balance.
- **Claim Request Submission**: Submitted by providers upon discharge with final bill, discharge summary, and itemised claims.
- **Communication Request**: Enables payers to query providers for additional documents (`additionalinfo`), flag turnaround-time breaches (`tatquery`), or issue policy updates.
- **Payment Notice & Reconciliation**: Payers notify providers of bank transfers (UTR), detailing claimed, approved, TDS, and settled amounts.
- **Reprocess / Cancel / Shortfall**: Providers appeal rejected claims (`reprocess`), request partial payment balance (`partialpayment`), or cancel approved preauthorisations.
- **Beneficiary Notifications**: Push notifications to personal health record (PHR) apps on claim status changes.

- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/A5.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Predetermination, Status and Search, A5](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/predetermination-status-and-search#a5-get-status-shared)

Where any request you made got to, by its correlation id. The sandbox's own status page answers without a token.

### A6: Receive errors

- **Role / Side:** `shared`
- **API Called:** `(hosted only)`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/error`
- **Carries JWE:** `false`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/A6.yaml`

Where the exchange tells you a request could not be delivered after five attempts. Without it a sender never learns that a request died, which looks exactly like a case still under review.

**Data elements**

| Element         | Label                 | Group | Type     | Card.  | FHIR path                     | Example                                        | Notes |

## Provider Use Cases

The following use cases are initiated by Provider participants (hospitals, daycare centers) to verify coverage, submit preauthorisations, answer queries, submit claims, and reconcile payments.

### B1: Check coverage eligibility

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/coverageeligibility/check`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/coverageeligibility/on_check`
- **Workflow ID:** `none; sits beside registration 10 and admission 11`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B1.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Coverage Eligibility Request, B1](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/coverage-eligibility-request#b1-check-coverage-eligibility-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (5):** `B1-check.json`, `auth-requirements.json`, `benefits.json`, `discovery.json`, `validation.json`

Is the policy in force, what is left in the wallet, and what must be attached. One endpoint, four purposes: discovery, validation, benefits, auth-requirements.

### B2: Request insurance plan

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/insuranceplan/request`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/insuranceplan/on_request`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B2.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Insurance Plan Request, B2](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/insurance-plan-request#b2-request-insurance-plan-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (2):** `B2-request.json`, `insurance-plan-request.json`

A Task with code poll, keyed on policy number and provider id. The answer is the policy as a benefit structure: packages, rates, documents, questionnaires.

### B3: Submit pre-authorisation

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/preauth/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/preauth/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `12 new, 121 resubmission, 13 enhancement; under PMJAY 19 answers a query and 131 an enhancement query`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B3.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Preauthorisation Request, B3](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/preauthorisation-request#b3-submit-pre-authorisation-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (6):** `B3-enhancement.json`, `B3-request.json`, `preauth-cancel.json`, `preauth-enhancement.json`, `preauth-queryupdate.json`, `preauth-request.json`

Permission to treat. A resubmission, an enhancement and a query answer all reuse the same bundle with a new correlation id and the original reference; only the workflow code tells them apart. The acknowledgement on 20 brings the payer's own case number, and the desk files everything under it.

### B4: Respond to a communication

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/communication/on_request`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/communication/request`
- **Workflow ID:** `24, 241 or 27, echoed from the payer's request`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B4.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Communication, B4](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/communication#b4-respond-to-a-communication-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (5):** `B4-claim-query-answer.json`, `B4-preauth-query-answer.json`, `communication-acknowledgement.json`, `communication-request.json`, `communication-response.json`

Acknowledge or answer a message the payer sent about a case. A generic or IRDAI payer raises its query here, as a CommunicationRequest task bundle carrying 24, 241 or 27; the answer is a Communication task bundle on on\_request that echoes the request's correlation id and workflow id. The payer's reason code says what kind of message it was.

### B5: Submit claim

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/claim/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/claim/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `15 claim, 161 query answer under PMJAY, 14 provisional discharge where a payer supports one`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B5.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Claim Request, B5](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/claim-request#b5-submit-claim-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (5):** `B5-request.json`, `claim-queryupdate.json`, `claim-release.json`, `claim-reprocess.json`, `claim-request.json`

Reimbursement after discharge. The amount may not exceed what the pre-authorisation approved. The acknowledgement on 25 brings the payer's case number. PMJAY takes a claim query answer on 161 only; 151, 19 and 16 are refused with PAYR-1321.

### B6: Search claims

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/search/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/search/on_submit`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B6.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Predetermination, Status and Search, B6](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/predetermination-status-and-search#b6-search-claims-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `claim-search.json`

Look up claim information by criteria. The provider sandbox exit checklist names /v1/search/submit for claim search, while the Technical Specifications route /search/submit from NHA through NHCX to the payer: a cross-payer search for NHA or a regulator. A provider's search over its own cases is /claim/search in the protocol, which the access-control policy allows for requests that originated from the provider. No source confirms which of the two the sandbox accepts from a provider.

### B7: Acknowledge payment notice

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/paymentnotice/on_request`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/paymentnotice/request`
- **Workflow ID:** `30 echoed from the notice on the generic network; 17 under PMJAY`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B7.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Payment Notice and Acknowledgement, B7](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/payment-notice-and-acknowledgement#b7-acknowledge-payment-notice-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (2):** `B7-acknowledgement.json`, `payment-notice-ack.json`

The receipt for a payment notice, as a Task on this endpoint. The notice arrives on a new thread of its own; a generic payer takes the acknowledgement with the notice's 30 echoed, PMJAY with 17.

### B8: Reprocess or cancel

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/task/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/task/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `PC01 cancel, 36 reprocess or shortfall`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B8.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Cancel, Reprocess and Shortfall, B8](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/cancel-reprocess-and-shortfall#b8-reprocess-or-cancel-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (2):** `B8-cancel.json`, `B8-reprocess.json`

One endpoint, several jobs, told apart by the Task's code and reason: reprocess with claimrejected, shortfall with partialpayment, cancel. A reprocess goes on 36 and is acknowledged on 37; a cancel goes on PC01 and is done on PC02. Both carry the input intimationNumber. A supporting document is mandatory on a reprocess.

### B9: Submit predetermination

- **Role / Side:** `provider`
- **API Called:** `/v1/predetermination/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/predetermination/on_submit`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/B9.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Predetermination, Status and Search, B9](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/predetermination-status-and-search#b9-submit-predetermination-provider)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `predetermination-request.json`

What would the payer approve for this treatment? Same bundle shape as a pre-authorisation, asked before committing to one.

## PMJAY Scheme Use Cases

The following use cases govern the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) cashless lifecycle as detailed in the official NHA PMJAY Handbook. They follow strict Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG), mandatory biometrics, package rules, and Turnaround Time (TAT) auto-approvals.

### D1: Fetch the insurance plan

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/insuranceplan/request`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/insuranceplan/on_request`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D1.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Insurance Plan Request, D1](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/insurance-plan-request#d1-fetch-the-insurance-plan-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D1-request.json`

Keyed on provider id, policy code and participant id. The answer is the scheme configuration for this hospital: specialities, packages, rates, Claim-Condition flags, mandatory documents and questionnaires. Over twenty megabytes; store it queryable, version it, refresh weekly and on any policychange communication.

### D2: Authenticate the beneficiary

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `ABHA biometric auth init and verify (not NHCX)`
- **Carries JWE:** `false`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D2.yaml`

Fingerprint, iris or face; all three must be built. Success yields a user token valid thirty minutes that rides on the eligibility check and the pre-authorisation; a fresh one rides on the claim. Where biometrics are impossible, a signed exemption consent and the matching questionnaire stand in, except on a cyclic case.

### D3: Check coverage eligibility

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/coverageeligibility/check`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/coverageeligibility/on_check`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D3.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Coverage Eligibility Request, D3](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/coverage-eligibility-request#d3-check-coverage-eligibility-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D3-check.json`

Validation after registration returns the wallet, one benefit entry per wallet with allowed and used. Benefits and auth-requirements before a pre-authorisation return what the package needs attached. Register only after coverage is validated, and validate again every time treatment is added.

### D4: Submit pre-authorisation

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/preauth/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/preauth/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `12`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=preauth&usecase=initiate`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D4.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Preauthorisation Request, D4](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/preauthorisation-request#d4-submit-pre-authorisation-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D4-request.json`

Not more than one day before admission, with the biometric token or the consent response, the documents the auth-requirements answer asked for, the STG questionnaire for each package, and the registration and admission dates as supporting info. Auto-approved only if it is the first pre-authorisation for the case and every package allows it.

### D5: Resubmit pre-authorisation

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/preauth/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/preauth/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `121`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=preauth&usecase=resubmit`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D5.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Preauthorisation Request, D5](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/preauthorisation-request#d5-resubmit-pre-authorisation-pmjay)

Revises an approved or rejected case for a different amount or package. Nullifies every earlier instance; the payer treats it as the new base request.

### D6: Raise an enhancement

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/preauth/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/preauth/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `13, and 131 to answer an enhancement query raised on 241`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=preauth&usecase=enhance`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D6.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Preauthorisation Enhancement, D6](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/preauthorisation-enhancement#d6-raise-an-enhancement-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (2):** `D6-enhancement-query-answer.json`, `D6-enhancement.json`

Adds to an approved pre-authorisation, as many times as needed until discharge, one at a time, and only for packages whose plan flag allows it. The bundle carries the approved items and the ones now sought. A query on it arrives as a ClaimResponse on 241, on the case's own thread, and is answered by a fresh submit on 131.

### D7: Answer a pre-authorisation query

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/preauth/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/preauth/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `19`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=preauth&usecase=query-answer`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D7.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Preauthorisation Query and Answer, D7](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/preauthorisation-query-and-answer#d7-answer-a-pre-authorisation-query-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D7-query-answer.json`

The query arrived as a ClaimResponse on 24, on the case's own thread, with the question in the item adjudication, not on the communication API. Answer with a fresh submit of the same bundle shape on this code, never as a new 12, which opens a second case.

### D8: Cancel pre-authorisation

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/task/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/task/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `PC01`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=preauth&usecase=cancel`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D8.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Cancel, Reprocess and Shortfall, D8](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/cancel-reprocess-and-shortfall#d8-cancel-pre-authorisation-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D8-cancel.json`

A Task with code cancel, the case number as input and one of seven reasons: treatmentplanchanged, patientrequest, financialconstraints, alternativetreatment, duplicateclaim, administrativeerror, other. Allowed at any point until the claim is raised.

### D9: Submit claim

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/claim/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/claim/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `15`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=claim&usecase=submit`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D9.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Claim Request, D9](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/claim-request#d9-submit-claim-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D9-request.json`

There is no discharge submission: the claim asserts the discharge and carries its details. Four dates, the discharge type under category DIS with the stage as its value, a fresh biometric token, and LM100 as the single procedure in place of the approved items on a LAMA or DAMA discharge before or during surgery. The amount may not exceed what was approved.

### D10: Answer a claim query

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/claim/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/claim/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `161`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=claim&usecase=query-answer`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D10.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Claim Query and Answer, D10](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/claim-query-and-answer#d10-answer-a-claim-query-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D10-query-answer.json`

As D7, on the claim endpoint: the query is a ClaimResponse on 27, the answer a fresh submit on 161. The sandbox refuses 151, 19 and 16 with PAYR-1321. The final adjudication then arrives with outcome complete and, often, a deductible adjudication naming why the eligible amount is less than the claimed one.

### D11: Reprocess a rejected claim

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/task/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/task/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `36`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=claim&usecase=reprocess`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D11.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Cancel, Reprocess and Shortfall, D11](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/cancel-reprocess-and-shortfall#d11-reprocess-a-rejected-claim-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D11-reprocess.json`

An appeal, not a resubmission: a Task with code reprocess and reason claimrejected, a supporting document attached, no amount. Raise it the moment the rejection arrives. Once only; the Claim Review Committee is final.

### D12: Claim a shortfall

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/task/submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/task/on_submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `36`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=claim&usecase=shortfall`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D12.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Cancel, Reprocess and Shortfall, D12](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/cancel-reprocess-and-shortfall#d12-claim-a-shortfall-pmjay)

The same Task with reason partialpayment and an amount capped at the difference, allowed only after payment notice 33 has arrived and been acknowledged with 17. Once only, and never after a reprocess.

### D13: Acknowledge the payment notice

- **Role / Side:** `pmjay`
- **API Called:** `/v1/paymentnotice/on_request`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/paymentnotice/request`
- **Workflow ID:** `17`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Simulator Console:** `/builder?family=paymentnotice&usecase=acknowledge`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/D13.yaml`
- **FHIR Reference:** [Payment Notice and Acknowledgement, D13](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/payment-notice-and-acknowledgement#d13-acknowledge-the-payment-notice-pmjay)
- **Sample FHIR Bundles (1):** `D13-acknowledgement.json`

Three notices may arrive: 30 when the transfer is initiated, 31 when the bank processes it, 33 when it settles with the UTR. The reconciliation splits the amount into what was paid and what was deducted as tax. Keep the UTR; it is the reference for any dispute.

## Payer Use Cases

The following use cases are implemented by Payer participants (Insurance Companies and Third Party Administrators) to respond to provider inquiries, adjudicate claims, raise queries, and settle payments.

### C1: Link ABHA with policy

- **Role / Side:** `payer`
- **API Called:** `/participant/link/abha/policy`
- **Carries JWE:** `false`
- **Simulator Console:** `/participants`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/C1.yaml`

Tie the ABHA number, mobile and member id to the policy's products at policy creation, naming the payer and the processor. This is what makes A2 answer.

- **Sample FHIR Bundles (2):** `C4-response-generic.json`, `C4-response-pmjay.json`

The plan as a benefit structure. Under PMJAY this is the scheme configuration for one hospital and can exceed twenty megabytes.

### C5: Respond to pre-authorisation

- **Role / Side:** `payer`
- **API Called:** `/v1/preauth/on_submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/preauth/submit`

The adjudicated pre-authorisation. The acknowledgement on 20 travels as response.partial and carries the payer's own case number; the decisions travel as response.complete. Read outcome and the adjudication amounts together: complete covers approval and denial alike. Under PMJAY a query is this ClaimResponse on 24 or 241, on the case's own thread.

### C6: Raise a communication

- **Role / Side:** `payer`
- **API Called:** `/v1/communication/request`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/communication/on_request`
- **Workflow ID:** `24, 241, 27 for a generic payer's queries; N02 and the intimation codes for the rest`

- **Sample FHIR Bundles (3):** `C6-claim-query-wf27.json`, `C6-notification-wfN02.json`, `C6-preauth-query-wf24.json`

A message about a case, typed by its reason code: additionalinfo, tatquery for a turnaround breach, grievance, walletupdate, policychange, claimArbitration. A generic or IRDAI payer raises its document queries here, as a CommunicationRequest task bundle carrying 24, 241 or 27, and takes the answer as a Communication task bundle on on\_request echoing the correlation id and workflow id. PMJAY does not use it for queries; its query is the ClaimResponse on the case's own thread.

### C7: Respond to claim

- **Role / Side:** `payer`
- **API Called:** `/v1/claim/on_submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/claim/submit`

The adjudicated claim, item by item, with any deduction and its reason. The acknowledgement on 25 travels as response.partial with the payer's case number. Under PMJAY a query is this ClaimResponse on 27, answered by a fresh submit on 161.

### C8: Respond to search

- **Role / Side:** `payer`
- **API Called:** `/v1/search/on_submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/search/submit`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/C8.yaml`

- **Sample FHIR Bundles (3):** `C9-notice-tds-wf30-pmjay.json`, `C9-notice-wf30.json`, `payment-notice.json`

The money, on a new thread of its own, with the reconciliation itemised by type: approved, claimed, tds, servicetax, advance, recovered, penality. The bank's UTR rides on the settled notice.

### C10: Respond to a Task

- **Role / Side:** `payer`
- **API Called:** `/v1/task/on_submit`
- **Callback API:** `/v1/task/submit`
- **Workflow ID:** `251 acknowledged, 252 approved, 253 rejected, 254 queried, PC02 cancelled, 37 arbitration acknowledged`
- **Carries JWE:** `true`
- **Data Element Mapping:** `package/mappings/C10.yaml`

The answer to a reprocess, shortfall or cancel. A cancellation done is PC02 and carries the case's ClaimResponse in its output; a reprocess on 36 is acknowledged on 37 as arbitration. Both payers answer this way.

### C11: Respond to predetermination

- **Role / Side:** `payer`
- **API Called:** `/v1/predetermination/on_submit`

| `claim`         | `query-answer`      | **Answer a query**    | `claim`                | `v1/claim/submit`              | `request`    | The claim processing doctor asked for more. Same bundle, same case number, the extra evidence attached.                   |

| `paymentnotice` | `acknowledge`       | **Acknowledge**       | `payment-ack`          | `v1/paymentnotice/on_request`  | `on_request` | The receipt for a payment notice. Acknowledging does not resolve whatever the notice was about.                           |
| `search`        | `search`            | **Search**            | `search`               | `v1/search/submit`             | `request`    | Where a case got to, asked as a Task. Check Status answers the same question without a bundle.                            |

## Testing Against the Dummy Payer

The sandbox hosts a payer that answers back, participant ID `1000003538@hcx`. It handles insurance plan, coverage eligibility, preauthorisation, claim, payment notice and communication. For the plan call use provider ID `32722` and policy `100217`.

Two test hooks drive its decisions:

- `dummyhcxpayer/process/request` makes it approve, reject or query a preauthorisation or claim you have submitted, by correlation ID.
- `dummyhcxpayer/paymentNotice/init` makes it send you a payment notice.

A query from the dummy payer arrives as a communication request, which you answer on `/v1/communication/on_request` before the final decision comes back on `on_submit`.

## Workflow Codes Cross-Reference

Endpoints alone do not identify a transaction. A new preauthorisation, a resubmission, an enhancement and a query response all travel on `/v1/preauth/submit` with the same bundle. The workflow code in the header is what tells them apart, and each code expects a particular status word. See [Workflow Codes](/docs/pr-19/docs/nhcx/v1/concepts/workflow-codes) for the complete state machines and code tables.
