# Screens

Every screen of the desk, the registry, the configuration and the finance flows, in one list. Each row links to its full spec in [../screens/](../screens/INDEX.md). Routes are the application's own; S4 to S9 are screens most payer systems already have, and only their NHCX additions are built.
