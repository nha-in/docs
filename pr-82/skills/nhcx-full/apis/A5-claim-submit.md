# A5. Claim Submit

#### A5E. ENDPOINT
In-process: `gateway.send("v1/claim/submit", envelope)`, [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md), which encrypts it and posts it to NHCX for the payer: `POST {nhcx}/v1/claim/submit`. The verdict comes back asynchronously on `claim/on_submit` (taken in by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md), callback C6 through the callback door C1, type `claim`, or found by polling the [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md), A10 / A11 / A12 / A13).

#### A5D. DESCRIPTION
Files the claim once the patient has left: the pre-authorisation's bundle with `use: claim`, the payer's pre-auth reference on the insurance line, the Procedure marked completed, the claim-stage documents and forms, and the discharge on `supportingInfo`. It is also the route for answering a claim query in `resubmit` mode, and for resubmitting a decided claim where the payer takes that.

**Send kinds.**

| Where the claim stands | Kind |
|---|---|
| No claim record, or `draft` | `claim` |
| `queried` | `claim_query_response` |
| `approved`, `partial` or `rejected`, when the adapter has a resubmit workflow | `claim_resubmit` |
| `approved`, `partial` or `rejected`, adapter has none | refused: "The payer has decided this claim; it goes back for another look as a reprocess request, not as a claim sent again." |
| `error` | the kind that failed is sent again (`claim_query_response` or `claim_resubmit`), else `claim` |
| `submitting` | refused: "The claim is with the payer; wait for its answer before sending again." |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) (the bundle id and Claim anchor of each kind), [F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md)

**Status (`x-hcx-status`).** Set by the send, not left to the gateway's path default: `response.complete` for a claim query answer (`claim_query_response`), `request.initiated` for everything else, as NHA's workflow sheet pairs them (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)). The reference implementation left it to the default, `request.initiated`, on every send [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Workflow ids (`x-hcx-workflow_id`)**, from the payer adapter (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers), overridable per environment (a JSON object of kind to workflow id):

| Kind | `pmjay` | `xyz` (Sandbox Payer) | `generic` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claim` | 15 | 15 | 15 |
| `claim_query_response` | 161 | 151 | 151 |
| `claim_resubmit` | none (not offered) | 16 [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | 16 [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) |

16 (claim resubmitted) is not in NHA's published workflow list; the reference implementation used it for the non-PMJAY adapters [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Confirm with the payer before offering a resubmission.

PMJAY refuses 16, 151 and 19 on a claim with PAYR-1321 "Invalid workflow id" and takes 161 for a query answer [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers), so a decided PMJAY claim goes back only as a reprocess Task (A6) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Headers set by the application** (G7 generates the rest, [G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)): `x-hcx-sender_code` = facility participant code; `x-hcx-recipient_code` = the case's processing id (D9 `processing_id`), else the case's processing id, else the claim's payer id, else the configured default payer code; `x-hcx-workflow_id` as above.

**Checks before sending**, in order:
1. The send-kind refusals above.
2. On `claim_query_response` with no reply text: "Write the reply to the payer's query before answering it."
3. "Record how the patient was discharged before claiming."
4. "A claim goes in against an approved pre-authorisation." (the pre-auth must be `approved` or `queried`)
5. "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings before submitting."
6. "Link the admitted patient before submitting."
7. "Enter the admission date on the preauth draft."
8. "Quote at least one ICD-10 diagnosis."
9. "Add at least one doctor to the care team."
10. "Add at least one line, the procedure being done."

#### A5Q. REQUEST

The arguments passed to G7 Send:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jwe_headers` | object | The three headers above |
| `fhir` | Bundle | The Claim bundle |

The resources are those of the pre-authorisation bundle (A4 REQUEST), with the claim leg's differences: `use` claim, the pre-auth reference, the discharge, the claim lines (a LAMA or DAMA discharge before or during surgery collapses them to the single procedure `LM100` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)), the Procedure completed, and only the claim-stage documents and forms.

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md), [F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md), [F15. Patient](../fhir/F15-patient.md), [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md), [F18. Coverage](../fhir/F18-coverage.md), [F16. Practitioner and PractitionerRole](../fhir/F16-practitioner.md), [F19. Other bundle resources](../fhir/F19-other-resources.md) (Procedure), [F7. QuestionnaireResponse](../fhir/F7-questionnaireresponse.md)

Envelope (PMJAY first claim):

```json
{
  "jwe_headers": {"x-hcx-sender_code": "<facility code>",
                  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<payer code>",
                  "x-hcx-workflow_id": "15"},
  "fhir": <F1 Bundle carrying F8 Claim (use claim, preAuthRef, discharge), F15 Patient, F17 provider and payer Organizations, F18 Coverage, F16 Practitioner, F19 Procedure (completed), F7 QuestionnaireResponse per answered claim-leg form>
}
```

A PMJAY query answer goes under workflow `161` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) with the reply text riding on the Claim as the "Claim query detail" entry (F8), for example "Final bill and discharge summary attached again; the ward stay was two days as billed.".

#### A5S. RESPONSE

**Acknowledgement:** the G7 result, `{"ok": true, "gateway_status": 202, "txn_id", "correlation_id", "request_id", "headers", "response", ...}`. The claim leg becomes `submitting` under its ids (`txn_id`, `correlation_id`); the previous verdict fields are cleared. On a query answer the question being answered is kept so it can still be shown.

**Failed send.** When the failure names ids, the leg is kept under them as refused at the door: a query answer goes back to `queried` with the question restored and the message recorded; any other kind becomes `error`. A later answer on the failed send's correlation reopens the leg.

Data: [D20. claim_submission](../database/D20-claim-submission.md)

Reply: [C6. Claim Reply](../callbacks/C6-claim-on-submit.md)

**Polling** (claim `submitting`, on each load of S6): A10 (G9 related) with the claim's `txn_id`, newest inbound ClaimResponse via A12. With none, a refused payer answer when one G hosts both participants, or a ProtocolResponse for this correlation found through A13 (type `claim`) and A12, is applied as a refusal at the door; then A11 (G9 dispatch), where `dispatch_failed` is also a refusal at the door with the ledger's `errorMessage` / `errorCode` / "Dispatch to NHCX failed.". When G9 no longer holds the transaction (A10 not found), the claim turns to `error`: "The gateway no longer has this transaction, its ledger was reset after the claim was sent. Submit again."
