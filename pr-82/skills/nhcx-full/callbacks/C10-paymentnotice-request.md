# C10. Payment Notice

#### C10E. ENDPOINT
Delivered in-process by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) for NHCX route `v1/paymentnotice/request`, passed to `C1.receive` with `delivery.type` `payment`. Payer-initiated; acknowledged by A8 automatically.

#### C10D. DESCRIPTION
The one leg the payer starts: it posts a notice when money moves, often twice per payment (initiated, then cleared) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). For payment notice the provider exposes `paymentnotice/request` and calls `paymentnotice/on_request`, the opposite way round from every other exchange.

**Matching by claim number, not correlation id.** Nothing of ours was sent, so the notice is matched by the case number it carries. The number is read, in order, from the PaymentNotice, the PaymentReconciliation, the Task, then the first entry's own resource; on each resource an identifier typed `CLN` wins, and an untyped identifier is taken rather than ignored (the live payer sends the number with no type) [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The bundle identifier is never tried: live it is a message uuid [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The number is looked up against the case (D9 `claim_no`), then the number each leg went out under (D20 `claim_ref`, then D18 `claim_ref`), because a cancel retires a number. Nothing matching: `unmatched`.

**Redelivery.** A notice whose correlation id is already on a payment row (D21 `correlation_id`) is `ignored`.

**Same payment, further along.** A notice whose `PaymentNotice.id` is already on a payment row of the same case updates that row instead of adding one (the IRDAI sandbox payer keeps the id) [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers), and is acknowledged again on its new thread.

**Acknowledgement is best-effort.** The notice is recorded first, then acknowledged through A8. A failed acknowledgement is kept on the row and the result is still `settled`, so G8 accepts the message; failing it would only have NHCX deliver it again.

#### C10Q. REQUEST
`fhir` is an F1 Bundle carrying a Task (what happened, in prose), an F13 PaymentNotice (amount and `paymentStatus`) and a PaymentReconciliation (date, UTR and the `detail[]` breakdown), usually with F17 Organizations. Some payers send only the PaymentNotice and PaymentReconciliation.

#### C10S. RESPONSE
`settled` for a new or updated notice (whether or not the acknowledgement went), `ignored` for a redelivery, `unmatched` when no case answers to the number, or `rejected` with `That is not a payment notice.` when the bundle has neither a PaymentNotice nor a PaymentReconciliation (a `ProtocolResponse` included).

State changes:

| Table | Change |
|---|---|
| D21 claim_payment | new row (or the earlier row for the same `notice_id` updated): `claim_ref`, `notice_id`, `disposition`, `payment_status`, `payment_date`, `amount`, `currency`, `utr`, `correlation_id`, `sender_code`, `workflow_id`, `received_at`, `notice_json`; then `ack_status` `sent` with `ack_txn_id`, `ack_correlation_id`, `acknowledged_at`, or `error` with `ack_error` |
| D22 claim_payment_detail | one row per reconciliation detail (replaced on an update) |
| D9 claim | `stage` `payment`, `sub_stage` `paid` or `noticed` (restamped) |
