# F12. Communication

#### F12R. RESOURCE
- `resourceType`: `Communication` (the reply), inside a `Bundle` `type: collection` with profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/TaskBundle`, wrapped by a `Task`.
- Profiles in `meta.profile`: Communication `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Communication`; Task `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Task`.
- Direction: **sent**, on NHCX route `v1/communication/on_request`, sent by A7 through [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md), on the thread of the payer's CommunicationRequest (F11). Also **received**: a bare Communication from the payer is a note (last section).

#### F12D. DESCRIPTION
One route carries two different bundles:

| Variant | Answers | Sent | Carries a Communication? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reply | a query (`D23 claim_query.kind = query`) | when the desk sends the reply form | yes: a new Communication with the text and files |
| Acknowledgement | a notification (`kind = notification`) | automatically on arrival; by hand again after a failure | no: the payer's own bundle sent back with its Task `completed` |

A note (`kind = note`) gets neither.

**Reply bundle.** Entries in this order:
1. Task (new): `deliver`, `completed`, its one `include` input pointing at the Communication.
2. Communication (new).
3. The payer's CommunicationRequest, exactly as it arrived, under its own fullUrl. When the stored request has none, a minimal `{"resourceType": "CommunicationRequest", "id": <request_id or new uuid>, "status": "active"}` at `urn:uuid:<id>`.
4. The case, as the payer already holds it: Claim, Patient, provider Organization, payer Organization, every Practitioner, Coverage. Lifted, deep-copied, from the queried leg's own sent bundle (A5 for leg `claim`, else A4; if the first has no Claim the other leg's is tried). Organizations: the one typed `prov` is the provider (else the one at `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/provider`, else the first); the next one is the payer. When no leg ever went out, they are built from the case: a stub Claim at `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/<preauth|claim>/request` (F8), Patient (F15, from the claim row only), the two Organizations (F17), Coverage (F18). No Practitioner then.

**Refusals before building** (reply): "Query not found."; "That message is not a question: a notification is acknowledged and a note is read, neither takes an answer."; "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings before answering a query."; "Write a reply or attach a document, an empty answer tells the payer nothing."; "One of the chosen documents is not on this claim."

**Acknowledgement bundle.** The request bundle as stored (`D23 claim_query.request_json`), sent back with:
- the payer's Task first, deep-copied, `status` set to `completed`; intent, code and reason as sent;
- when the request came without a Task, a new one: `status: completed`, `intent: proposal`, `code` `poll` under `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/financialtaskcode`, `authoredOn` now, `requester` the payer Organization, `owner` the provider Organization, `reasonCode` from `D23 claim_query.reason_code` under `ndhm-reason-code` with its words, and an `include` input pointing at the CommunicationRequest; fullUrl `urn:uuid:<new>`;
- the Organizations grouped where the first one stood (at the end when there were none), the facility's first. The facility's is the one the Task `owner` or a request `recipient[]` points at; else the one typed `prov`; else, when the payer named nobody, the facility's own Organization is built (F17) and put first, followed by whatever the payer sent (or a built payer Organization when it sent none);
- every other entry in place, deep-copied; entries without fullUrl get `urn:uuid:<id or new uuid>`.

Refusals: "Query not found."; "Only a notification is acknowledged; a query is answered from the communication tab."; "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings first."
