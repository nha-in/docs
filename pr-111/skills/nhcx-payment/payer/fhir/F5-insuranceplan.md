# F5. InsurancePlan

#### F5R. RESOURCE
`InsurancePlan`, `meta.profile` `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/InsurancePlan`, in a bundle profiled `.../InsurancePlanBundle` (F1). Direction: sent on `v1/insuranceplan/on_request` by A2. Insurance Plan Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer), answering C3. Insurance Plan Request (in nhcx-coverage/payer) on the request's correlation id. Entries: the InsurancePlan at `urn:uuid:<plan id>`, the payer Organization (F17) at `urn:uuid:<org id>`, then one Questionnaire (F6) per covered procedure that has one, each at its canonical `url`.

Extensions written: `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Claim-Condition`, `.../Claim-Exclusion`, `.../Claim-SupportingInfoRequirement`.

#### F5D. DESCRIPTION
One product ([D12. policy](../database/D12-policy.md)) rendered as the plan a hospital reads into its package master. When the request named an enrolment (the subscription id an eligibility answer handed out), the plan is that person's cover: the period and plan type come from [D6. subscription](../database/D6-subscription.md). Without one it is the product on offer: the period is the calendar year of today, and the render notes that it was assumed [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Two trees, both written.** The hospital reads `plan[].specificCost[]` first and `coverage[]` for whatever it did not carry, merged on the package code (the provider skill's rule), so this payer writes the priced procedures in both places with the same benefit `id` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers):

- `coverage[]`: one entry per SNOMED coverage clause ([D14. policy_coverage_clause](../database/D14-policy-coverage-clause.md)) with its benefits ([D15. policy_clause_benefit](../database/D15-policy-clause-benefit.md)) and limits, then one entry per procedure category ([D10. procedure_rule](../database/D10-procedure-rule.md)) holding one benefit per covered procedure ([D13. policy_procedure](../database/D13-policy-procedure.md)). A clause with no benefits is written as a benefit of itself, because `coverage.benefit` is 1..*.
- `plan[0]`: `identifier` the product name (`use: official`), `type` the plan type (`https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/CodeSystem/ndhm-plan-type`), `generalCost[0].cost` the sum assured, then `specificCost[]`: one per sub-limit ([D18. policy_sub_limit](../database/D18-policy-sub-limit.md)) with a cost typed `fullcoverage`, and one per procedure category whose benefits are the **priced** procedures with a cost typed `Procedure` ("Selected treatment or service or product is a type of procedure or package", ndhm-plan-type). A procedure without a package rate is listed under `coverage[]` only and never priced [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**A procedure benefit** (`coverage[].benefit[]` and `plan[].specificCost[].benefit[]` alike): `id` the package code, `type` the code in the payer's own system `<base>/CodeSystem/procedure` with the SNOMED and ICD-10-PCS codings beside it when the registry holds them, and three kinds of extension as siblings:
1. one `Claim-Condition` with sub-extensions `ProcedureType` (the category), `IsDayCare` (`Y` when the category is Day Care) and `ImplantApplicable` (`Y` when a required document is filed under the NDHM implant category `IMP`); nothing else is asserted, because an unrecorded condition written as `N` would invent a rule [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers);
2. one `Claim-SupportingInfoRequirement` per required document at each phase ([D11. procedure_rule_doc](../database/D11-procedure-rule-doc.md) `preauth`, `discharge`, `claim`), url `<ext>/<package>/<phase>/<doc code>`, children `category` (the document type's NDHM supporting-information category, `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/CodeSystem/ndhm-supportinginfo-category`) and `code` (the payer's document taxonomy `<base>/CodeSystem/nhcx-document-type`, [D3. document_type](../database/D3-document-type.md)); a document type with no category is left out and noted;
3. one `Claim-SupportingInfoRequirement` for the treatment guideline, url `<ext>/<package>/STG`, category `INF`, code `STG` "Standard Treatment Guidelines", and `documentationUrl` a reference to the Questionnaire's url (F6). Written only when the procedure has a Questionnaire.

**Root extensions.** One `Claim-Exclusion` per exclusion ([D17. policy_exclusion](../database/D17-policy-exclusion.md)): `category` the exclusion code (`https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/CodeSystem/ndhm-claim-exclusion`), `statement` the wording, and `item` the one SNOMED concept it names when there is one.

**The empty plan.** A request naming a product this payer does not file is answered, not refused: a bundle carrying the payer Organization and no InsurancePlan, because the IG allows an empty plan and silence would leave the hospital polling (A2. Insurance Plan Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer)). A retired product's code answers with the default policy the enrolments were moved onto [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Issues.** The render reports where the data fell short of the profile (no UIN, no coverage at all, a code with no display) as a list beside the bundle, shown on the FHIR preview (S11. FHIR Preview (in nhcx-coverage/payer)); the bundle still goes.
