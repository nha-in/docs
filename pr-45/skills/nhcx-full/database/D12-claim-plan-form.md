# D12. claim_plan_form

#### D12T. TABLE
One row is one payer questionnaire (dynamic form) shipped with a claim's package master; primary key `id`; parent table [D10. claim_plan](D10-claim-plan.md).

#### D12D. DESCRIPTION
The payer's InsurancePlan bundle carries Questionnaire resources: policy forms and standard-treatment-guideline (STG) checklists that a document requirement points at through its `documentationUrl`. The payer sends the same form once for every benefit that needs it, so forms are collected by `url` and stored once per plan. Answers are stored per claim in [D17. claim_form_answer](D17-claim-form-answer.md), keyed by the same url (`form_url`).

Which forms a leg must carry:
- With a `ready` auth-requirements ruling ([D13](D13-claim-auth.md)): the forms named by its `form` requirements ([D15](D15-claim-auth-requirement.md) `form_url`) for that stage (`at_preauth = 1` for the pre-authorisation, `0` for the claim).
- Without a ruling, pre-authorisation only: the forms named in `supporting_info[].form` of the quoted packages ([D11](D11-claim-plan-benefit.md)).
- On both legs, always: the policy-wide forms named in the plan's `policy_documents[].form` ([D10](D10-claim-plan.md)). A form answered earlier is offered again with the earlier answers filled in.
- Nothing is required unless the plan is `ready`.

Each question in `items` is a flattened Questionnaire item:
- `linkId`, `type`, `text` (the item's `prefix`, else its `text`), `required`.
- `depth`: nesting level, `0` for top-level items.
- `options`: `answerOption` `valueString`, else the valueCoding's display or code.
- `initial`: the first option marked `initialSelected`, the payer's default answer.

Lifecycle:
- Inserted when a plan reply is applied, after all the plan's earlier forms are deleted in the same transaction.
- Copied from another claim's `ready` plan when a master is reused.
- A refetch request does not delete forms. They are replaced when the reply is applied.
- Deleted with the plan (`ON DELETE CASCADE`).
- Never updated in place.
