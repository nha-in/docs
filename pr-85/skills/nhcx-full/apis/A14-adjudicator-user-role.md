# A14. Adjudicator User Role

#### A14E. ENDPOINT

Outbound, application to the payer side. Asks which role is holding a case in the payer's adjudication workflow. There are two transports. Which one is used depends on the payer's adapter (`desk`, see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The embedded gateway, [G](../gateway/INDEX.md), has no adjudicator relay, so the payer service is always called directly.

| Transport | Call | Chosen when |
|---|---|---|
| Payer service | `POST https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/nhcxpayerservice/v1/get/user-role` (the URL can be overridden per deployment), with a bearer token (a configured payer service token, else the [G3. Session Token](../gateway/G3-session-token.md) through A16) | The desk is `nhcx-payer-service`. |
| IRDAI payer desk | `POST {desk}/api/auth/login`, then `GET {desk}/api/cases?search=<case number>` (desk URL set per deployment, default `http://localhost:8082` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) | The desk is `irdai-payer`. |

A payer whose adapter has no desk is refused before any call with "`<payer name>` has no adjudication desk this EMR can drive; the decision is taken on the payer's own console." A blank case number is refused with "A case number is needed to read who is holding it."

#### A14D. DESCRIPTION

On PMJAY the decision on a pre-authorisation or a claim is taken in the NHCX Payer Service, outside the exchange [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). A case sits at exactly one step, and only the role holding it may act. So the role is always read first, and the actions offered are that role's only. The lookup is a live call. It is made only when the operator asks ("Read the current role"), and before every action of a cycle (see A15), never on a plain page view.

The case number sent is the number the payer knows the leg by:

- For the `nhcx-payer-service` desk: the last `/`-separated segment of the pre-authorisation's payer reference (for example the 16 digits at the end of `PMJAY/HP/S/2024/R2/<16 digits>`), or the whole reference when it has no `/` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The claim leg uses the same number, since the scheme keeps one case per episode [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- Otherwise: the claim number that leg went out under (`claim_ref`), else the claim's current number.

The payer code is the payer's participant code with everything from `@` removed (the numeric part of `<payer code>`) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### A14Q. REQUEST

**Payer service.** Direct HTTP call from the application, outside NHCX and outside G. Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`, `accept: application/json`, `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `bearer_auth: Bearer <token>` (the same token in both). Timeout 30 s [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `caseid` | string | yes | The case number, as above. |
| `payerid` | string | yes | Payer code without the `@` suffix. |

```json
{"caseid": "1234567890123456", "payerid": "<payer code without @hcx>"}
```

**IRDAI payer desk.** Sign in with `POST /api/auth/login` `{"username", "password"}` (the desk's configured adjudicator account). The `token` in the reply is kept for later calls. Then `GET /api/cases?search=<case number>` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The case is the row whose `claim_no` equals the case number.

#### A14S. RESPONSE

The application reduces every transport to one reply object:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `role` | The role holding the case, or blank. |
| `step` | The published workflow step for that role (`step`, `stage`, `role`, `actions`, `usecase`), present only when the role is one of the seven below. |
| `warning` | Set when the role is not in the workflow ("`<role>` is not a role in the published workflow, read the raw response before acting."), or when no role came back and there is no error ("the payer service returned no role field this EMR recognises, read the raw response."). |
| `error` | The payer service's own error text, when there is one. |
| `response` | The decoded reply body, shown raw on the screen. |
| `raw` | The reply text when it was not JSON (payer service only). |
| `status` | HTTP status. |
| `caseNumber`, `payerCode` | What was asked (payer service; `caseNumber` on IRDAI). |
| `transport` | Which transport answered: `nhcx-payer-service` or `irdai-payer`. |

**Reading the role (payer service).** The published guide does not show the reply, and the sandbox has used more than one field name [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The role is found by comparing keys with case and punctuation ignored, in this order: `currentUserRole`, `currentRole`, `userRole`, `currentRoleName`, `assignedRole`, `roleName`, `role`. Then any string field whose name contains "role". Then the same search inside `data`, `result`, `response` or `payload`. A list reply is read from its first element. Example replies: `{"currentUserRole": "CPD-Trust"}`, `{"data": {"rolename": "SHA-Trust"}}`, `[{"userRole": "ACO-Trust"}]`. An empty role (`{"currentUserRole": ""}`) means nobody holds the case any more.

**Errors.**
- Payer service, non-2xx: `error` is "the payer service returned `<status>`: `<text>`". The text is the body's `errorMessage`, `error`, `errorDesc`, `errorDescription` or `message` (the first found), else the first 200 characters of the body.
- Payer service, 2xx: an `errorMessage`, `error`, `errorDesc` or `errorDescription` in the body is still set as `error`. A bare `message` on a 2xx is not an error, because the service says "processed" in that field when it succeeds [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- Payer service host unreachable: refused with "`<url>` is unreachable, `<reason>`".
- No token: the A16 failure is the lookup's failure.
- IRDAI: a failed sign-in gives "The IRDAI payer desk refused the sign-in (HTTP `<status>`): ...". A failed case list gives "The IRDAI payer desk could not list cases (HTTP `<status>`): ...", and the kept sign-in token is dropped. No matching row gives "The IRDAI payer holds no case under `<case number>`."

**Legal actions by role.** The role decides which actions A15 may send; the roles and actions below are the PMJAY workflow's [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Names are matched loosely (`ppd-trust` and `CPD Trust` both match), but the action is always sent spelled as below.

| Step | Stage | Role | Legal actions | `usecase` sent in A15 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | PREAUTH | PPD-Trust | `Approve`, `Reject`, `Query` | `PREAUTH` |
| 1 | CLAIM | CEX-Trust | `Forward` | `CLAIM` |
| 2 | CLAIM | CPD-Trust | `cpdApprove`, `cpdReject`, `Pending` | `CLAIM` |
| 3 | CLAIM | Medical Audit Committee | `Approve`, `Reject`, `iQuery` | `Medical Audit Committee` |
| 4 | CLAIM | ACO-Trust | `Approve`, `Reject`, `Pending` | `CLAIM` |
| 5 | CLAIM | SHA-Trust | `Approve`, `Reject`, `Pending` | `CLAIM` |
| 6 | CLAIM | Claim Review Committee | `Approve`, `Reject`, `Pending` | `Claim Review Committee` |

A role outside this table gets no actions. The screen says "`<role>` is not a role in the published workflow, so no action can be offered for it."

**IRDAI desk reply.** Always `role: "Adjudicator"`, `status: 200` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The `step` is `{"stage": "<case stage in upper case, or CASE>", "usecase": "<case stage>", "role": "Adjudicator", "actions": ["approve", "reject", "query"]}`. The `response` is `{"id", "stage", "adjudication"}` taken from the matched case.

```json
{
  "caseNumber": "1234567890123456",
  "payerCode": "<payer code without @hcx>",
  "status": 200,
  "response": {"currentuserrole": "CPD-Trust"},
  "raw": null,
  "transport": "nhcx-payer-service",
  "role": "CPD-Trust",
  "step": {"step": 2, "stage": "CLAIM", "role": "CPD-Trust",
           "actions": ["cpdApprove", "cpdReject", "Pending"], "usecase": "CLAIM"}
}
```

#### A14P. PSEUDOCODE
