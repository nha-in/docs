# FHIR

Every FHIR resource the application builds for NHCX or reads back, in one list. Each row links to its full spec in [../fhir/](../fhir/INDEX.md). Sent profiles are the NRCeS profiles under `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/`; received resources are read without checking a profile.

## Envelope

| # | Resource | Direction | What it is | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [F1](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) | Bundle | both | The envelope of every NHCX message: bundle id, profile, anchor entry first and a fixed entry order, absolute URLs under `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in` as references. | [A2](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md), [A3](../apis/A3-insurance-plan-request.md), [A4](../apis/A4-preauth-submit.md), [A6](../apis/A6-task-submit.md), [A12](../apis/A12-txn-fhir.md), [C1](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md), [C3](../callbacks/C3-auth-requirements-on-check.md), [C4](../callbacks/C4-insuranceplan-on-request.md), [C5](../callbacks/C5-preauth-on-submit.md), [C7](../callbacks/C7-cancel-on-submit.md), [C8](../callbacks/C8-enquiry-on-submit.md) |
