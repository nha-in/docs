# G1. Embedding

#### G1E. ENTRY

In-process calls the application makes to run the gateway, in this order:

| Call | Returns | When |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway.open(options)` | a gateway, or an error | once at startup, before the listener opens |
| `gateway.log_startup()` | nothing (log lines) | right after `open` |
| `gateway.handler()` | an HTTP handler for the NHCX-facing routes | once, mounted on the application's own listener |
| `gateway.start(ctx)` | nothing (starts two background loops) | once, before or as the listener starts serving |
| `gateway.check()` | nothing (log lines) | once, in the background, after the listener is serving; skippable (G11) |

Stopping is cancelling `ctx`: both loops return, and the application shuts its own HTTP server down (the reference host waits up to 30 s for in-flight requests [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)).

In-process calls the application makes to use the gateway once it is open. None of them is an HTTP hop:

| Call | Spec | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `gateway.send(path, envelope)` | G7 | A2 to A8 |
| `registry.policies_search(query)` | G10 | A1 |
| `registry.abha_link(body)`, `registry.abha_delink(body)` | G10 | available to the application; no API in this skill uses it (ABHA linking is the payer's or beneficiary's step) |
| `ledger.related`, `ledger.dispatch`, `ledger.fhir`, `ledger.list` | G9 | A10 to A13 |
| `gateway.token(participant)`, `gateway.refresh_token(participant)` | G3 | A16 |
| `gateway.check()` | G11 | startup, in the background |

The one call the gateway makes into the application: `C1.receive(envelope, delivery)`, once per accepted inbound message (G8).

HTTP routes the handler serves. These are the only routes the application mounts, because NHCX and probes are the only outside callers:

| Method and path | Caller | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /in/<nhcx path>` | NHCX | inbound message for a registered `endpoint_url` of `https://<host>/in`, for example `/in/v1/preauth/on_submit` (G8) |
| `POST /v1/<rest>` | NHCX | the same, for an `endpoint_url` registered as the bare host; the path handed on is `v1/<rest>` (G8) |
| `GET /healthz`, `GET /in/healthz` | probes | liveness (G11). `/in/healthz` is reachable under an `endpoint_url` ending in `/in` |
| `POST /healthz`, `POST /in/healthz` | the endpoint probe of `gateway.check` | liveness plus the probe acknowledgement (G11) |
| `GET /readyz` | probes | 200 when the default participant holds a session token (G3, G11) |

Outbound URLs the gateway calls (NHCX gateway, participant registry, session endpoint) are set per environment in G2.

#### G1D. DESCRIPTION

The gateway is a library inside the application process, not a separate service. The application opens it with the path of its configuration file (G2) and the function that receives inbound messages (C1), mounts one HTTP handler for NHCX on its own listener beside its own routes, and calls the gateway's functions directly to send (G7), search policies and link or delink ABHA (G10), poll the ledger (G9), read a session token (G3) and run the startup checks (G11).

**What the application passes to `open`.**
- `config_path`. Keys and the ledger directory resolve relative to that file's directory.
- `receive`: the application's C1 function. G8 calls it with the decrypted envelope and the delivery values, waits for its outcome, and only then answers NHCX (202 when C1 took the message, an error status otherwise, so NHCX redelivers). The `callback` section of the config file is not used (G2). Every profile, hosted code and guest delivers to this one function; C1 tells them apart by `delivery.participant` and `delivery.path`.
- `host`: extra participant codes to answer for, as code to display name. Each shares the default participant's client id, secret and private key. A code the file already lists keeps the file's entry. The application reads these codes and names from its own configuration, never from code; the reference host lists its PMJAY desk's code there [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- `guests`: whether to take in messages for participant codes the gateway does not list (G2 guests, G8). Unset leaves the file's `guests` setting. The reference host turns guests on so the application serves any participant code whose registry record carries this gateway's `endpoint_url` and certificate.
- `version`: reported by `/healthz`. Default `embedded`.

**Order inside `open`.** Load the file (G2: parse, `${ENV}` expansion, env var overrides, defaults, `@file` keys, validation), add the hosted codes, apply the guests setting, then run the serve-time validation (G2). Only then are the profiles and keys built (G2), the token and certificate caches created (G3, G4) and the ledger opened (G9). `open` makes no network call.

**Mounting.** Mount the handler so that NHCX reaches `/in/...` (or `/v1/...`) and the health routes, and nothing else of the gateway faces the internet. Behind a front proxy that forwards only `/api/...`, the same NHCX-facing routes can also be mounted under `/api/gateway/...` (so `/api/gateway/in/...`, `/api/gateway/v1/...`, `/api/gateway/healthz`, `/api/gateway/in/healthz`, `/api/gateway/readyz`), with the registry's `endpoint_url` set to `https://<host>/api/gateway` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The host's HTTP server needs a long write timeout (reference: 90 s [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)), because an inbound request is held open while C1 runs.

**Middleware on the mounted routes**, outermost first: panic recovery (answers 500 `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "INTERNAL", "message": "internal error"}}`), a request id (the caller's `X-Request-Id` when present and at most 128 characters, else a fresh UUID; echoed as `X-Request-Id`), and a body cap of `maxBodyBytes` (G2; over the cap is `BODY_TOO_LARGE`, HTTP 413, "request body exceeds <n> bytes").

**Background loops started by `start`.**
- Token refresher: at once, then every minute, for every profile (default first) ask G3 for a token under a 30 s deadline. G3 returns the cached token unless it is missing or within one minute of expiry, so profiles that share a client id cost one fetch. A failure is logged ("session token refresh failed") and the next tick or the next send tries again. This keeps the first send from paying for the token.
- Ledger pruning: only when the ledger is enabled. At once, then every hour, `ledger.sweep(now)` deletes day folders older than `ledger.retentionDays` (0 keeps everything) and drops them from the in-memory indexes (G9). Logs "ledger pruned" with the count when anything went.

**`check`** runs the startup checks of G11 against the registry and logs each result. It never stops the process and never writes to the registry: the application is already serving, and NHCX redelivers anything that fails meanwhile. It takes up to 2 minutes for the checks plus 30 s for the endpoint probe, so run it in the background.

**`log_startup`** logs one line naming the NHCX URL and how many participants are held, one line per profile (code, name, whether it is the default), and one line when guests are on.

#### G1Q. INPUT

`gateway.open` options:

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config_path` | string | required | the gateway config file (G2) |
| `receive` | function `(envelope, delivery) -> outcome` | required | C1.receive; the only delivery target (G8) |
| `host` | map code to name | none | codes (with or without `@hcx`) added as hosted profiles sharing the default's credentials and key |
| `guests` | boolean or unset | unset | true takes in unlisted recipient codes that one of the gateway's keys opens; false refuses them; unset keeps the file's `guests` section |
| `version` | string | `embedded` | shown by `/healthz` |

`start` takes a cancellable context; cancelling it stops the loops. `check` takes the same context.

#### G1S. OUTPUT

`open` returns the gateway or an error. Errors, verbatim shapes:
- config read or parse: `read config: <cause>`, or `<config path>: <cause>` for parse, key file and validation failures (G2 lists the causes; several validation failures are joined, one per line).
- serve-time validation: `<config path>: <cause>` (G2).
- a private key that does not parse: `participant.privateKey: <cause>` or `participants[<i>].privateKey: <cause>` (G2).
- the ledger directory cannot be opened: the file system error.

`handler` returns the handler. `start`, `check` and `log_startup` return nothing; their outcome is in the logs. What the mounted routes answer is in G8 (inbound) and G11 (health).
