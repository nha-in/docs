# C5. Pre-auth Reply

#### C5E. ENDPOINT
Delivered in-process by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) for NHCX route `v1/preauth/on_submit`, passed to `C1.receive` with `delivery.type` `preauth`. Answers A4 in all its sends: a pre-authorisation, a query answer, an enhancement, an enhancement query answer, and a predetermination (quote).

#### C5D. DESCRIPTION
A pre-authorisation is answered several times on one correlation id: an acknowledgement (PMJAY workflow `20`, `outcome: queued`), sometimes a query, then the decision (workflow `21`) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Every reply the leg has not already taken in is applied; a guard that refused anything after the first reply would throw the approval away.

**Matching.** By `x-hcx-correlation_id` against the pre-authorisation (D18 `correlation_id`, newest row). When none matches, against the predetermination quotes (D19 `correlation_id`, newest row). Neither: `unmatched`.

**Redelivery.** On the pre-authorisation, the same `x-hcx-api_call_id` as the last applied reply is a redelivery (`ignored`). The `redelivery` flag G8 takes from [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md) is not used for this: the leg's own `api_call_id` decides. Without an api_call_id, a reply with the same outcome and adjudication as the leg already holds is treated as the same message, unless the leg is still `submitting`. On a quote, anything after the first answer is `ignored`.

**Legs that have moved on.** A `cancelled` pre-authorisation ignores every reply. While a cancel is out (`cancelling`), only a ClaimResponse adjudicated `cancelled` is applied, as the payer confirming the withdrawal on the pre-authorisation's own thread; anything else is left for the cancel Task (C7).

**Failed sends.** A leg whose send was reported failed (C1 `failed_send`) is reopened as `submitting` when the payer answers it, then the reply applied.

#### C5Q. REQUEST
`fhir` is an F1 Bundle carrying the payer's F9 ClaimResponse (`use: preauthorization`, or `predetermination` for a quote), usually beside F15 Patient, F17 Organizations and F18 Coverage; some payers send the ClaimResponse alone.

A pre-authorisation usually gets two replies on its thread: an acknowledgement, which leaves the leg `submitting`, then the decision, which settles it. Refusals arrive as a `ProtocolResponse` (for example PAYR-1255, PAYR-1008 [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)).

#### C5S. RESPONSE
`settled`, `unmatched`, `ignored` (redelivery, cancelled leg, a non-cancel reply while cancelling, a quote no longer `asking`), or `rejected` when the bundle carries no ClaimResponse.

State changes, D18 claim_preauth (each write restamps D9 `stage` / `sub_stage`):

| Reply | `status` | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| acknowledgement (`queued`, `submitted`) | `submitting` | parsed columns, `api_call_id`, `settled_at` null, `response_json`, `thread_correlation_id` |
| decision | `approved`, `partial`, `queried` or `rejected` | as above, `settled_at` now |
| ClaimResponse adjudicated `cancelled` while `cancelling` | `cancelled` | `outcome`, `adjudication`, `disposition`, `api_call_id`, `settled_at`, `response_json`. The claim number is not retired here (C7 does that) |
| `ProtocolResponse` | `error`, or `approved` for an enhancement | `error_message` `<code>: <message>`; `correlation_id` back to `thread_correlation_id` when one is held |

Parsed columns: `outcome`, `adjudication`, `disposition`, `preauth_ref`, `approved_amount`, `eligible_amount`, `submitted_amount`, `items_json`, `query_note`.

D19 claim_predetermination: `answered` whatever the outcome, with `outcome`, `adjudication`, `disposition`, `allowed_amount` (the `benefit` total), `answered_at`, `response_json`; or `error` with `<code>: <message>`. Nothing on the pre-authorisation changes.
