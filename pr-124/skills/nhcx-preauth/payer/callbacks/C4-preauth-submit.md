# C4. Pre-auth Submit

#### C4E. ENDPOINT
Delivered in-process by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) for NHCX route `v1/preauth/submit`, passed to `C1.receive`, classified `preauth` because the bundle holds a `Claim` with `use` `preauthorization` ([F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md)). Acknowledged inside the same delivery by [A3. Pre-auth Answer](../apis/A3-preauth-answer.md) (outcome `queued`, workflow 20, `response.partial`) on `v1/preauth/on_submit`; the verdict follows when a person decides on the desk ([S3. Case Desk](../screens/S3-case-desk.md), [A13. Adjudicate](../apis/A13-adjudicate.md)), on the same correlation id.

#### C4D. DESCRIPTION
The hospital's send carries `x-hcx-use_case` (`New`, `Enhancement` or `Resubmit`) on every pre-authorisation. This payer does not need it, since it tells a comeback from a first filing by the case the Claim names, and must not refuse a send for carrying it.

The one inbound flow that is not decided where it arrives. A hospital submits a Claim; this payer files it as a case ([D19. case](../database/D19-case.md)) and a person approves, queries or rejects it hours later. The verdict is a ClaimResponse addressed with the correlation id the submission arrived under, which sits on the case until then.

**Acknowledged at once, decided later.** NHCX keeps a thread open only while it is being answered: a submission left silent is redelivered, then dropped, its correlation id retired, and the real verdict is refused minutes later with NHCX-1010 ("no data with given correlation id for call back request"). So the filing is followed at once by [A3. Pre-auth Answer](../apis/A3-preauth-answer.md) sending a ClaimResponse with outcome `queued` under workflow 20 and `x-hcx-status` `response.partial`: received, not decided. The live PMJAY payer answers the same way [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers), and hospitals built from the provider skill read a queued answer as an acknowledgement, not a decision. The acknowledgement is best-effort: a case is filed whether or not it got out, nothing is marked answered by it, and the verdict still goes.

**Proof of presence.** The send may carry the beneficiary's user token on its protected headers (the header its onboarding names, default `x-hcx-user-token`, with `x-hcx-ben-abha-id`), from a biometric authentication the hospital did against ABHA; a hospital may send it to any payer. This payer records it on the case's exchange. Under the `pmjay` profile the live scheme refuses a pre-authorisation that carries neither a valid token nor the Authentication Consent QuestionnaireResponse (PAYR-1256; PAYR-1272 for a lapsed token): this desk files the case regardless and notes on its timeline which of the two it found, so a hospital built from the provider skill sees the same refusal only where the scheme would give it [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Three things a pre-authorisation Claim can be.** In this order:

1. **A redelivery.** A case already holds this correlation id ([D19. case](../database/D19-case.md) `nhcx_correlation_id`, unique): `ignored`, with the case named. Two deliveries racing land on the unique index, and the loser reads the winner's case.
2. **A comeback**: an enhancement or a resubmission answering a query, on a pre-authorisation already on file. The reference shape is the whole pre-authorisation again under the same claim number, the added lines beside the original ones; an older sender names the prior on `Claim.related` (relationship `prior`), `insurance[].preAuthRef` or an identifier typed `PAR` and carries the added lines alone. Either way the new lines go on the existing case for a fresh decision; no second case opens. Which case (`case_come_back_to`): a prior named outright is the only thing looked up when there is one; otherwise the claim number itself, as long as that case is past its first filing: from the same sender, addressed to this participant, open (stage `preauth` or `claim`), not cancelled, and not a pending case being sent new lines (that is a fresh filing racing this one, not a comeback). A case whose claim leg is already filed takes no enhancement: more money is the claim's business.
3. **A new case.** The enrolment is found by the same handles an eligibility enquiry uses (C2. Coverage Eligibility Check (in nhcx-coverage/payer)): in force first, else the most recent cover the person had, so a lapsed policy is filed and refused with the reason rather than dead-lettered as "no such person". No enrolment at all is a permanent refusal: "No enrolment matches the patient on this pre-authorisation" (`rejected`; the same envelope redelivered would find the same nothing).

**What a comeback does.** The lines not already on the bill (matched on code, description and claimed amount, because the reference repeats the original lines beside the new ones) are the enhancement; they join the case pending, in a new round (`enhancement_no`), through the same store transition the desk's own enhancement uses, and lines already decided keep their decisions. When the case is `queried`, the submission is first taken as the answer to the query (workflow 121 or 131 [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)): the queried lines go back to pending with the hospital's note (the `CQD` supporting information, else "Resubmitted by <sender> (<claim ref>)."), its documents are filed, the open query thread on the case is cleared. No new lines and no open query, with a prior named: `rejected`, "An enhancement has to ask for something"; without a prior named it is the same bundle again, `ignored`. A case that is closed answers "The pre-authorisation <ref> is <stage> and takes no enhancement" or "That case is closed and takes no resubmission" or "... takes no enhancement" (`rejected`). Then the pre-auth thread is reopened on this correlation id (`ReopenPreauthThread`: the new correlation id replaces the old, the answer transaction is cleared so a fresh verdict may go, a case at stage `claim` with no claim leg filed goes back to `preauth`), and the comeback is acknowledged like a first filing.

**What a new case takes from the bundle.** The patient on the case is this payer's member, not the name the hospital typed: the enrolment is the record of who they are. What the hospital states about the admission is taken as sent: hospital (name, HFR id), admission date (the `ADDD` or `EDT` supporting information, else `Coverage.period.start`, else today), expected discharge, urgency from `Claim.priority` (`stat` or `asap` Emergency, `urgent` Urgent, else Elective), diagnoses (the first primary, the rest secondary), the care team by HPR id, procedures named by the package each item bills, line items (quantity, unit price, `net`, a ward or ICU tier riding as a modifier beside the line, never as a line of its own), and the attachments. The age is the member's on the admission date. A document under a code this payer's taxonomy does not carry is filed as `ODN` with its original code on the timeline ("Attachments Filed as Other"): evidence a hospital sent is evidence an adjudicator has to see. Inline attachment bytes are kept ([D24. case_document_file](../database/D24-case-document-file.md)). Answered forms ride in the bundle ([F7. QuestionnaireResponse](../fhir/F7-questionnaireresponse.md)) and are read from the archived message when the desk shows them ([A15. Case Exchange Log](../apis/A15-case-exchange.md)).

**Routing slip.** The case records the correlation id, the sender, the participant code it was addressed to and the hospital's own claim number (`nhcx_claim_ref`, which is not this payer's `claim_no`). The verdict, the query and the payment notices all address the sender.

#### C4Q. REQUEST
`fhir` is an [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) Bundle carrying [F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md) Claim (`use: preauthorization`) with [F15. Patient](../fhir/F15-patient.md) Patient, the provider and payer [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md) Organizations, [F18. Coverage](../fhir/F18-coverage.md) Coverage, [F16. Practitioner](../fhir/F16-practitioner.md) Practitioner per care-team member, [F19. Other resources](../fhir/F19-other-resources.md) Procedure per procedure line, and [F7. QuestionnaireResponse](../fhir/F7-questionnaireresponse.md) QuestionnaireResponse per answered form. Headers read: `x-hcx-sender_code`, `x-hcx-recipient_code`, `x-hcx-correlation_id`, `x-hcx-workflow_id` (12 first request, 121 resubmission, 13 enhancement, 19 and 131 query answers under the `pmjay` dialect [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); nothing routes on it).

#### C4S. RESPONSE
`settled` when a case was opened or a comeback filed (and acknowledged, best-effort); `ignored` for a redelivery or the same bundle again; `rejected` when no enrolment matches, the case is closed, or an enhancement asks for nothing; `error` on an unexpected failure.
