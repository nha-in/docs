# A4. Pre-auth Submit

#### A4E. ENDPOINT
In-process: `gateway.send("v1/preauth/submit", envelope)`, [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md), which encrypts it and posts it to NHCX for the payer: `POST {nhcx}/v1/preauth/submit`. The payer's answer comes back asynchronously on `preauth/on_submit` (taken in by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md), callback C5 through the callback door C1, type `preauth`, or found by polling the [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md), A10 / A11 / A12 / A13).

#### A4D. DESCRIPTION
Sends the pre-authorisation Claim bundle for one case. The same route carries two things:

- **The pre-authorisation itself** (`Claim.use = preauthorization`), in four send kinds that share one bundle and differ only in the Claim's anchor, the bundle id and the workflow id.
- **A predetermination** (`Claim.use = predetermination`): the same dossier sent as "what would you pay for this", which binds nobody and opens no case. It goes on the preauth route because that is the NHCX route there is for it; `use` says what it is.

**Send kinds.** The kind is worked out from where the pre-authorisation stands:

| Where the pre-auth stands | Kind | Answers a query |
|---|---|---|
| Nothing sent, `cancelled`, `error`, `rejected` | `preauth` | no |
| `queried` | `preauth_query_response` | yes |
| `approved` / `partial` with lines added since the decision | `enhancement` | no |
| `queried`, when the last send was an enhancement round | `enhancement_resubmit` | yes |
| `approved` / `partial`, nothing added | refused: "The pre-authorisation is already decided; add a line to ask for an enhancement." | |
| `submitting` / `cancelling` | refused: "The pre-authorisation is with the payer; wait for its answer before sending again." | |
| (predetermination, any time the policy is eligible) | `predetermination` | no |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) (the bundle id and Claim anchor of each kind), [F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md)

A line counts as added when its code (or a ward tier code riding as a modifier) is not in the Claim of the last bundle sent. After a rejection the next send is a fresh `preauth` (12), not a resubmission: PMJAY refuses 121 there with PAYR-1214 [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Status (`x-hcx-status`).** Set by the send, not left to the gateway's path default: `response.complete` for a query answer (`preauth_query_response`, `enhancement_resubmit`), `request.initiated` for everything else, as NHA's workflow sheet pairs them (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)). The reference implementation left it to the default, `request.initiated`, on every send [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Workflow ids (`x-hcx-workflow_id`).** Read from the payer adapter chosen by the claim's payer participant code (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). An unmapped payer uses Generic.

| Kind | `pmjay` | `kyrocare` (Sandbox Payer) | `generic` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `preauth` | 12 | 12 | 12 |
| `preauth_query_response` | 19 | 19 | 19 |
| `enhancement` | 13 | 13 | 13 |
| `enhancement_resubmit` | 131 | 131 | 131 |
| `preauth_resubmit` (defined, never chosen by the send logic) | 121 | 121 | 121 |
| predetermination | always `12`, fixed in code, not read from the adapter [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | | |

A per-environment override (a JSON object of kind to workflow id) wins over the adapter, key by key. A kind with no id anywhere is refused with "No workflow id is defined for '<kind>'.".

**Headers set by the application.** Only these four; G7 generates ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)) `x-hcx-api_call_id`, `x-hcx-request_id`, `x-hcx-correlation_id`, the timestamp and the status.

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `x-hcx-sender_code` | The facility's NHCX participant code (Settings) |
| `x-hcx-recipient_code` | The case's processing id (D9 `processing_id`), else the case's processing id, else the claim's payer id, else the configured default payer code |
| `x-hcx-workflow_id` | From the tables above |
| `x-hcx-use_case` | `New` for `preauth` and a predetermination, `Enhancement` for `enhancement`, `Resubmit` for `preauth_query_response`, `enhancement_resubmit` and `preauth_resubmit`. Sent to every payer, whether or not it reads it (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) |

**Before a pre-authorisation send** (not a predetermination), the app fires the payer's `auth-requirements` coverage check (A2) when the adapter sends it unasked (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers), the claim is `eligible`, lines exist, and this procedure set has not been ruled on (or the last ruling is in `error`). It never waits for the answer, and a failure of that check does not stop the send.

**Checks before sending**, in order, each raised as the screen's red message:

Pre-authorisation:
1. "Submit a preauth only after the payer has confirmed the policy is eligible."
2. The send-kind refusals above.
3. On a query-answering kind with no reply text: "Write the reply to the payer's query before answering it."
4. "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings before submitting."
5. "Link the admitted patient before submitting."
6. "Enter the admission date on the preauth draft."
7. "Quote at least one ICD-10 diagnosis."
8. "Add at least one doctor to the care team."
9. "Add at least one line, the procedure being done."

Predetermination: "Ask for a quote only after the payer has confirmed the policy is eligible.", then "A quote is already with the payer; wait for its answer before asking again.", then checks 4 to 9.

#### A4Q. REQUEST

The arguments passed to G7 Send:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jwe_headers` | object | The three headers above, plus the beneficiary's user token under the configured header and `x-hcx-ben-abha-id` when [A18. Biometric Authentication](A18-biometric-authentication.md) holds a current stage-Preauth authentication (then the Authentication Consent form is left out of the bundle) |
| `fhir` | Bundle | The Claim bundle |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md), [F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md), [F15. Patient](../fhir/F15-patient.md), [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md), [F18. Coverage](../fhir/F18-coverage.md), [F16. Practitioner and PractitionerRole](../fhir/F16-practitioner.md), [F19. Other bundle resources](../fhir/F19-other-resources.md) (Procedure), [F7. QuestionnaireResponse](../fhir/F7-questionnaireresponse.md) (pre-auth only, not predetermination)

The bundle always carries every quoted line, also on an enhancement.

Envelope (PMJAY, first pre-authorisation):

```json
{
  "jwe_headers": {
    "x-hcx-sender_code": "<facility code>",
    "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<payer code>",
    "x-hcx-workflow_id": "12"
  },
  "fhir": <F1 Bundle carrying F8 Claim (use preauthorization), F15 Patient, F17 provider and payer Organizations, F18 Coverage, F16 Practitioner per care-team doctor, F19 Procedure per procedure line, F7 QuestionnaireResponse per answered form>
}
```

A query answer (workflow 19 under the `pmjay` adapter [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) differs only in the Claim anchor, the bundle id, and the reply text riding on the Claim as the "Claim query detail" entry (F8).

#### A4S. RESPONSE

**Acknowledgement** (the G7 result, NHCX status 202):

```json
{"ok": true,
 "gateway_status": 202,
 "txn_id": "7UPG003U",
 "ledger_id": "7UPG003U",
 "correlation_id": "f8425e75-52e0-4413-a915-39a7bad38ee2",
 "request_id": "0b398fdf-0516-4935-9ebb-a0dc90a06bb6",
 "headers": {"x-hcx-correlation_id": "f8425e75-52e0-4413-a915-39a7bad38ee2", "...": "..."},
 "response": "<NHCX's acceptance>"}
```

For a pre-authorisation the leg becomes `submitting` under the acknowledgement's ids (`txn_id`, `correlation_id`), and the verdict fields are cleared. An enhancement keeps the payer's pre-auth reference and counts one more round; a query answer keeps the reference and the round count. A predetermination adds a quote row in `asking`.

**Failed send.** Per the shared conventions. When the failure names ids, the leg is kept under them as refused at the door: `error` with the message for a `preauth` or a query answer. For an `enhancement` or an `enhancement_resubmit` the approval stands: the leg stays `approved` (or `partial`) and **keeps the approval's columns** (`request_json` of the last accepted send, `approved_amount`, `eligible_amount`, `outcome`, `adjudication`, `disposition`, `preauth_ref`, `items_json`, `settled_at`), and the failed send writes only its own ids (`txn_id`, `correlation_id`, `submitted_at`), `error_message`, `submission_kind`, `workflow_id` and `enhancement_no`. The added lines stay unsent and are offered again. A predetermination is stored as `error`. If the payer later answers on that correlation, the leg reopens and the answer is applied.

Data: [D18. claim_preauth](../database/D18-claim-preauth.md), [D19. claim_predetermination](../database/D19-claim-predetermination.md)

Reply: [C5. Pre-auth Reply](../callbacks/C5-preauth-on-submit.md)

**Polling** (while the leg is `submitting`, on each load of S6): A10 (G9 related) with the leg's `txn_id`; the newest inbound entry not sent by this facility whose bundle (A12) carries a ClaimResponse is applied. With no reply: a failed payer answer when one G hosts both participants ("The payer answered, but NHCX refused its reply..."), or a ProtocolResponse for this correlation found through A13 (type `preauth`) and A12, is applied as a refusal at the door. Otherwise A11 (G9 dispatch) is read, and a dispatch status of `dispatch_failed` turns the leg to `error` with the ledger's `errorMessage`, else `errorCode`, else "Dispatch to NHCX failed.". When G9 no longer holds the transaction (A10 not found), the leg turns to `error`: "The gateway no longer has this transaction, its ledger was reset after the preauth was sent. Submit again." Predetermination polling is the same without the A11 step, and its not-found message reads "The gateway no longer has this transaction. Ask again."
