# T13. PMJAY Eligibility, Package Master and Ruling

#### T13D. DESCRIPTION

The PMJAY start of a claim, as [T3. IRDAI Policy Search and Eligibility](T3-irdai-policy-and-eligibility.md) and T4. IRDAI Insurance Plan and Authorisation Requirements (in nhcx-preauth) are for IRDAI, under the `pmjay` adapter ([PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)): the policy search ([A1. Policy Search](../apis/A1-policy-search.md)), eligibility ([A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md), [C2. Coverage Eligibility Verdict](../callbacks/C2-coverage-eligibility-on-check.md)), the package master (A3. Insurance Plan Request (in nhcx-preauth)) and the ruling on authorisation requirements ([A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md) `auth-requirements`, C3. Authorisation Requirements Ruling (in nhcx-preauth)). PMJAY messages go to the policy's processing id (for PMJAY the state health agency), which the search returns; the payer id only chooses the adapter (CORE confusions).

**The package master is requested and then left alone.** PMJAY answers a plan request in 15 to 60 minutes, or not at all within a session, and refuses a second request meanwhile (PAYR-1406) [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). No test may depend on its arrival, and the seed is the only source of PMJAY STG and consent questions in a sandbox run. So this test sends A3. Insurance Plan Request (in nhcx-preauth) once, records the correlation id, and does not wait: it seeds a package master for the claim's policy and every PMJAY test runs on that. The seed is a few fixed packages that PMJAY approves at PPD-Trust without the plan being read back (fixed rates, no tiers, no implants, no documents beyond the ruling's), so a decision can be taken on them in T14. PMJAY Pre-authorisation Through the Payer Service (in nhcx-preauth) to T18. PMJAY Payment Notice, Status Refusal and Cancel (in nhcx-payment). When the real plan does arrive on C4. Insurance Plan Reply (in nhcx-preauth), it replaces the seed for that claim and the tests from then on use it.

#### T13S. SETUP

- The PMJAY test payer and the member id asked from the integrator ([T1. Test Configuration](T1-test-configuration.md)); `blocked` without it. The ABHA number is not needed: the registry returns it with the policy.
- A patient in the HMIS carrying that member id.
- The seed below, committed as `tests/nhcx/e2e/fixtures/pmjay-plan.json` (`NHCX_TEST_PMJAY_PLAN_SEED`). It is written exactly as given, not adapted: every code, name, price, flag, document and questionnaire is taken verbatim from PMJAY's own InsurancePlan answer for policy `PMJAY/HP/S/G` (the knowledge source's `fhir/C4/C4-response-pmjay.json`), cut down to two packages. Two is the most it holds, and which two is fixed:

| Package | Why it is in the seed |
|---|---|
| `SB043F` Hand (Single Stage Amputation), ₹18,600, surgical | The pre-authorisation and claim of T14. PMJAY Pre-authorisation Through the Payer Service (in nhcx-preauth), T15. PMJAY Query Answered by Resubmission (in nhcx-preauth), T17. PMJAY Claim Through the Role Walk (in nhcx-claim) and T18. PMJAY Payment Notice, Status Refusal and Cancel (in nhcx-payment): a fixed rate, no tiers, no implants, approval not required, one per episode. Enhancement is not allowed on it. |
| `MG072C` Acute Haemodialysis, ₹1,500 a cycle, medical, day care | The enhancement of T16. PMJAY Rejection and Enhancement (in nhcx-preauth): enhancement is allowed, and it is cyclic (up to 6 cycles), so the enhancement is one more cycle of it. |

How the seed is used:

- It is written into the claim's [D10. claim_plan](../database/D10-claim-plan.md) (status `ready`, its source marked as the test seed) and [D11. claim_plan_benefit](../database/D11-claim-plan-benefit.md) rows, and the questionnaires into [D12. claim_plan_form](../database/D12-claim-plan-form.md), through the same code path C4. Insurance Plan Reply (in nhcx-preauth) uses, so the screens and services see an ordinary plan. Never written where a real plan is already `ready`; removed when the run ends.
- The pre-authorisation of T14. PMJAY Pre-authorisation Through the Payer Service (in nhcx-preauth), T15. PMJAY Query Answered by Resubmission (in nhcx-preauth), T17. PMJAY Claim Through the Role Walk (in nhcx-claim) and T18. PMJAY Payment Notice, Status Refusal and Cancel (in nhcx-payment) quotes `SB043F` once, ₹18,600. The claim of T17. PMJAY Claim Through the Role Walk (in nhcx-claim) bills the same.
- The enhancement of T16. PMJAY Rejection and Enhancement (in nhcx-preauth) is on a claim that quoted `MG072C`: one cycle at pre-authorisation, and the enhancement adds a second cycle (₹1,500), which the package allows (cyclic, up to 6). `SB043F` is never enhanced: PMJAY does not allow it.
- Documents: the tests attach one small PDF under each document code the chosen package lists, at the `pre` stage, before sending (S9. Pre-authorisation (in nhcx-preauth)). The `Discharge Information` and `Discharge Consent` questionnaires and their attachments belong to the claim stage (S11. Claim Submission (in nhcx-claim)); the other five (`Admission Details`, `General Findings`, `Personal History`, `Family History`, `Authentication Consent`) are answered at pre-authorisation, the required items with the options given, attachments with a small PDF, the rest with plain values.
- **The consent questionnaires are not optional in the seed.** A PMJAY pre-authorisation or claim sent without a biometric token ([A18. Biometric Authentication](../apis/A18-biometric-authentication.md), [T19. PMJAY Beneficiary Verification and ABHA](T19-pmjay-biometric-and-abha.md)) is refused unless the Authentication Consent (`100024`, items `100093` attachment and `100095` string) rides on the pre-authorisation and the Discharge Consent (`100466`, item `135477` attachment) on the claim: PAYR-1256 and PAYR-1363 otherwise. They are answered as in the knowledge package's `fhir/D4/D4-request.json` and `fhir/D9/D9-request.json`. PMJAY's ruling names `100024` at pre-authorisation and nothing names `100466`, which is why the forms card offers a consent form whenever no token is held (S9. Pre-authorisation (in nhcx-preauth), S11. Claim Submission (in nhcx-claim)).

#### T13G. GUI

1. [S5. Claim Master](../screens/S5-claim-master.md), [S1. Search Policy](../screens/S1-search-policy.md), [S2. Select Policy](../screens/S2-select-policy.md): new claim, search by the PMJAY member id, pick the PMJAY policy.
2. [S3. Policy Discovery](../screens/S3-policy-discovery.md): discovery, then validation.
3. S7. Insurance Plan (in nhcx-preauth): request the package master once; read "fetching" and move on. Seed the package master (payer driver, [T2. Test Runners](T2-test-runners.md)); reload S7. Insurance Plan (in nhcx-preauth) and read it as `ready`.
4. S8. Line Items (in nhcx-preauth): add `SB043F` from the seed; S8.2 (in nhcx-preauth): validate.

#### T13L. CLI

1. [A1. Policy Search](../apis/A1-policy-search.md) with the member id; pick the PMJAY row; read the ABHA number the registry returned.
2. [A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md) `discovery` and `validation`; wait for [C2. Coverage Eligibility Verdict](../callbacks/C2-coverage-eligibility-on-check.md) each.
3. A3. Insurance Plan Request (in nhcx-preauth) once; record the correlation id; do not wait. Seed the package master for the claim's policy.
4. Add a line for `SB043F`; [A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md) `auth-requirements`; wait for C3. Authorisation Requirements Ruling (in nhcx-preauth).

#### T13X. EXPECT

- The search returns the PMJAY policy with both ids and the beneficiary's ABHA number, and every message is addressed to the processing id (read off the opened claim, as [T3. IRDAI Policy Search and Eligibility](T3-irdai-policy-and-eligibility.md) does).
- Both eligibility checks are answered; every claim line carries the programme code `AB-PMJAY` ([PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) and PMJAY's own code system; the facility is named by the HFR id on its own record.
- The plan request went out (NHCX 202) exactly once for this policy in the run; its correlation id is in the report. Its answer is not waited for. If it arrives, S7. Insurance Plan (in nhcx-preauth) shows the real plan in place of the seed.
- The seeded package master reads `ready` on S7. Insurance Plan (in nhcx-preauth) with exactly the two packages, their rates and documents as given, and the seven questionnaires: five at pre-authorisation (the four clinical forms and the Authentication Consent) and two at the claim (Discharge Information, Discharge Consent); S8. Line Items (in nhcx-preauth) lists both packages.
- The ruling arrives on the auth-requirements correlation id and lists what the chosen package needs at the `pre` stage.
