# Database

Every table behind the claim, patient and practitioner flows, in one list. Each row links to its full spec in [../database/](../database/INDEX.md), which gives the columns, keys and indexes. D1 to D8 are tables most HMIS already have (extended where NHCX needs a field); D9 to D30 are new for claims.

## Column types on a typed ORM

The DnC tables give SQLite-style types (`TEXT`, `REAL`, `INTEGER`, `BLOB`). On a typed database or ORM map them once, the same way everywhere:

| DnC type | Becomes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TEXT` holding an ISO instant the application writes (`created_at`, `submitted_at`, `settled_at`, `checked_at`, `requested_at`, `fetched_at`, `answered_at`, `received_at`, `acknowledged_at`, `*_at`) | an aware timestamp | stored in UTC, shown in the facility's zone |
| `TEXT` holding a **payer-supplied FHIR date** (D9 `plan_period_start`, `plan_period_end`, `patient_dob`; D20 `discharge_date`, `surgery_date`, `death_date`; D21 `payment_date`; D22 `date`) | **text, as received** | a FHIR date may be partial (`2026`, `2026-09`) or carry a time; parsing it to a date column loses or refuses values |
| `REAL` money | `DECIMAL(14, 2)` | never a float |
| `INTEGER` used as 0/1 (`inforce`, `auth_required`, `required`, `at_preauth`) | boolean | |
| `TEXT` named `*_json` | a JSON column | indexed only where a DnK says so |
| `BLOB` (D28 `data`) | the database's binary type, or file storage with the path in the column | |
| `TEXT` status columns | text with the DnD values as named constants | not an enum type: payers add statuses |

Index and constraint names are given in the DnK sections; a database or ORM that limits name length (30 characters is a common limit) shortens them as D19 does.
