# G4. Registry and Certificates

#### G4E. ENTRY

In-process, on the ABDM client of one profile (`identity_for(code).client`, G2):

| Call | Returns |
|---|---|
| `client.certificate(code)` | recipient public key and certificate PEM, from the cache when fresh |
| `client.fetch_certificate(code)` | the same, always from the registry, refreshing the cache |
| `client.forget_certificate(code)` | nothing; drops one cache entry |
| `client.own_key()` | this profile's own public key, or none |
| `client.fetch_participant(code)` | the participant's registry record |
| `client.post_registry(path, body)` | status and raw body of any other registry call |

HTTP routes the gateway calls, all `POST` with the session token (G3 `post_with_token`), base `urls.participant`:

| Call | URL | Body |
|---|---|---|
| certificate | `<urls.participant>/fetch/certs` | `{"participantid": "<code>@hcx"}` |
| record | `<urls.participant>/participant/search` | `{"participant_code": c, "participantcode": c, "participantid": c}` (all three spellings [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) |
| other | `<urls.participant>/<path>` | the caller's body, unchanged |

Sandbox base: `https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice`. Production base: `https://apis.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/hcx/participanthcxservice`.

#### G4D. DESCRIPTION

NHCX messages are encrypted to the recipient's registered encryption certificate, so every send needs the recipient's public key. The registry is also where a participant's record (name, status, `endpoint_url`, roles) and the beneficiary policy calls live.

**Certificate cache.** One in-memory cache shared by every profile, since a certificate describes the counterparty, not us. Keyed by the lowercased code with `@hcx`. An entry lives `certs.cacheHours` (24) [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). `certificate` answers from the cache while the entry is unexpired, else calls `fetch_certificate`. Reads take a shared lock and writes an exclusive one; two concurrent misses for the same code both go to the registry, and the last one written wins. Nothing is persisted. Failures are never cached: in particular the registry answers participants without a certificate with the text "Invalid Certificate Found" in place of a PEM, which fails to parse and is reported as `CERT_NOT_FOUND` every time [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Self-key guard.** When the registry hands back one of this gateway's own public keys (`owns_key`, G2) for a code the gateway does not hold itself, a payload encrypted with it could only be opened here, not at the recipient. With `certs.refuseSelfKey` true (the production default) that is `SELF_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and nothing is cached. In sandbox (default false) it is logged as a warning and used, because sandbox participants are often onboarded under one credential and really do share a certificate [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). A code the gateway holds itself (a participant sending to itself, or one hosted participant writing to another) is never refused.

**Which client asks.** A send fetches the recipient's certificate with the sender's client (G7), so the sender's token is used. The startup checks (G11) use each profile's own client for its own code. `post_registry` for policies uses the default participant's client (G10).

**`forget_certificate`** drops a stale entry so the next `certificate` goes to the registry. Use it when a recipient has rotated its certificate and a send fails at their end; otherwise the old key is used until the entry expires.

**`own_key`** is the public half of the profile's private key; the startup check (G11) compares it with what `fetch_certificate` returns for our own code.

**`fetch_participant`** accepts either answer shape: the record itself, or `{"participants": [...]}`, in which case the entry whose code matches is used, else the first entry.

**`post_registry`** exists for registry calls the gateway does not model (policy search and the ABHA link calls, G10). It adds the token handling, the refresh on 401 and the timeout, and interprets nothing: the caller gets the status and body as the registry sent them. Registry error bodies look like `{"error": {"code": "NHCX-1016", "message": "..."}}` or carry a top-level `message`.

#### G4Q. INPUT

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | required | participant code, with or without `@hcx`; normalised (G5) |
| `path` | required for `post_registry` | registry path, leading slash optional, for example `participant/get/policies` |
| `body` | required for `post_registry` | JSON value |
| `urls.participant` | env default (G2) | registry base |
| `certs.cacheHours` | `24` | cache lifetime |
| `certs.refuseSelfKey` | true in production, false in sandbox | self-key guard |
| `outboundTimeoutSeconds` | `30` | per call |

#### G4S. OUTPUT

`certificate` and `fetch_certificate` return `(public key, PEM string)`. The PEM is whatever the registry sent (it may be base64 of a PEM, see G6 key parsing).

`fetch_participant` returns:

| Field | Taken from (first non-blank) |
|---|---|
| `code` | `participant_code`, `participantcode`, `participantid`; normalised with `@hcx` |
| `name` | `participant_name`, `participantname`, `name` |
| `status` | `status` |
| `endpointUrl` | `endpoint_url`, `endpointurl`, `endpointUrl` |
| `roles` | the string items of `roles`, else of `role_code` |
| `raw` | the whole record |

`post_registry` returns `(status, raw body)`.

Errors (shape in G3S):

| Code | Message | Retryable |
|---|---|---|
| `NO_RECIPIENT` | `participant code is empty` | no |
| `CERT_FETCH_HTTP_<status>` | `participant registry refused the certificate lookup for <code>` | when status >= 500 or 429 |
| `CERT_FETCH_BAD_JSON` | `registry response is not JSON` | yes |
| `CERT_NOT_FOUND` | `registry returned no encryption certificate for <code>` | no |
| `CERT_NOT_FOUND` | `registry returned no usable certificate for <code>: "<first 120 characters of what it sent>"` | no |
| `SELF_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `registry certificate for <code> is this adapter's own key; a payload encrypted with it would be unreadable at the far end` | no |
| `PARTICIPANT_HTTP_<status>` | `participant registry refused the search for <code>` | when status >= 500 or 429 |
| `PARTICIPANT_BAD_JSON` | `registry response is not JSON` | no |
| `PARTICIPANT_NOT_FOUND` | `registry has no record for <code>` | no |
| `CERT_FETCH_UNREACHABLE`, `CERT_FETCH_READ_ERROR`, `CERT_FETCH_REQUEST`, `MARSHAL_ERROR`, `TOKEN_*` | from `post_with_token` (G3). The `CERT_FETCH_` prefix is used for every registry call, including the participant search and `post_registry` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | see G3 |

Upstream status and the clipped upstream body travel with the `_HTTP_` and `_BAD_JSON` errors. A send that fails with one of these reports it to the application as is (G7).
