# D19. claim_predetermination

#### D19T. TABLE
One row is one predetermination ask on a claim: the pre-authorisation bundle sent with `use: predetermination` and the payer's non-binding quote. Primary key `id`. Parent table: `claim` (D9), many rows per claim.

#### D19D. DESCRIPTION
A predetermination asks "what would the policy pay for this?" before anything is committed. The payer answers with a ClaimResponse that binds nobody and opens no case, so each ask is its own row rather than a state of the pre-authorisation (D18).

**Created.** "Ask for a quote" on Pre-authorisation (S9). Allowed only when the claim's eligibility status is `eligible` and no earlier ask on the claim is still `asking` ("A quote is already with the payer; wait for its answer before asking again."). The bundle is the pre-authorisation's (lines D16, diagnoses D25, care team D26, the leg's documents D28) under its own anchor. It goes out on the pre-authorisation route with `x-hcx-workflow_id` `12` (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The row is inserted with `status` `asking`, `txn_id`, `correlation_id`, `requested_at`, `requested_amount` (the lines total) and `request_json`. When [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md) reports the send failed after naming its ids, the row is inserted with `status` `error` and the message, and the error is shown.

**Statuses** (exact strings): `asking`, `answered`, `error`.

- `asking` to `answered`: a ClaimResponse arrives on the thread, by callback C5 (a pre-authorisation reply whose correlation id no D18 row holds is tried here) or by polling when the claim is opened. Whatever the outcome, the ask is answered: `answered_at`, `outcome`, `adjudication`, `disposition`, `allowed_amount` (the reply's `total` category `benefit`) and `response_json` are written and `error_message` cleared.
- `asking` to `error`: a ProtocolResponse on the thread, a peer or protocol error found by polling, or [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md) no longer holding the transaction (A10 finds nothing; the message tells the desk to ask again).
- `error` to `asking` to `answered`: an `error` row is revived when the payer answers on its thread anyway.
- An `answered` row ignores further replies.

**Deleted.** Never by the application; by cascade with the claim or when the transactional store is cleared.

#### D19K. KEYS AND INDEXES
- Primary key `id` (integer).
- Foreign key `claim_id` references `claim (id)` (D9), `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
