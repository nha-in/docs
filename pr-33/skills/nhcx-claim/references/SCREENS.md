# Screens

Every screen of the claim, patient and practitioner flows, in one list. Each row links to its full spec in [../screens/](../screens/INDEX.md). Routes are the application's own; "tab" means a tab of the claim page S6.

## Claims

| # | Screen | Route | What it does | APIs | Callbacks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [S5](../screens/S5-claim-master.md) | Claim Master | `claims/list` | Lists every claim case with beneficiary, policy, payer, balance, stage and status, filterable by status; the entry point to S1 and S6. | none | none |
| [S6](../screens/S6-claim-detail.md) | Claim Detail | `claims/view/:caseid` | The case shell: header chips, next-action buttons and the tabs in episode order. Polls every waiting leg on load. | [A17](../apis/A17-claim-state.md) | [C1](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md) |
| [S11](../screens/S11-claim-submission.md) | Claim Submission | `claims/view/:caseid/claim` | Records the discharge, collects claim-stage documents and forms, sends the claim, shows the verdict, and asks status, reprocess or release. | [A5](../apis/A5-claim-submit.md), [A6](../apis/A6-task-submit.md), [A10](../apis/A10-txn-related.md), [A11](../apis/A11-txn-dispatch.md) | [C6](../callbacks/C6-claim-on-submit.md), [C8](../callbacks/C8-enquiry-on-submit.md) |
