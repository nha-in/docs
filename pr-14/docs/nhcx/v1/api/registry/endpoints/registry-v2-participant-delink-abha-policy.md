# Submit the de-link ABHA policies (V2)

`POST /V2/participant/delink/abha/policy`

V2 variant of the ABHA policy de-link; same ParticipantDeLinkAbhaRequest body and response as the unversioned call.

### Business purpose

This endpoint performs the same member-layer removal as /participant/delink/abha/policy: it takes products out of a member's link for a given payer so that providers stop discovering lapsed or migrated coverage. The OpenAPI document exposes it as participantDeLinkAbhaPolicyV2 with an identical request and response schema; the documentation does not describe any behavioural difference beyond the path and operationId. It is the natural partner of /V2/participant/link/abha/policy for integrations that have standardised on the V2 paths.

### When to use

Use it in the same situations as the v1 de-link: policy termination, member removal, product migration, or as the first step when an insurer changes TPA (de-link, then link again with the new processingid). It is part of member-layer maintenance and is not tied to any claim workflow code. Pair it consistently with the V2 link and V2 get-policies calls.

### Preconditions

- A valid Bearer token from the client-credentials call (POST /get/session, form-urlencoded client_ID, client_secret, grant_type=client_credentials); tokens last 1200 seconds, so refresh before expiry.
- HTTP headers Accept: application/json, Content-Type: application/json and bearer_auth: Bearer <token> (the participant service uses bearer_auth, not Authorisation).
- Base path for the participant service: https://apisbx.ABDM.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice (sandbox) or https://apisprod.NHA.gov.in/pmjay/hcx/participanthcxservice (production).
- This is a synchronous plain-JSON registry call: no JWE envelope, no x-hcx-* protocol headers and no correlation ID are involved.
- The caller must be the payerid or processingid participant from the original link, using a token minted with the client_ID used at participant creation.
- Body: requestid (UUID), payerid, memberid and policies are required; processingid is optional; there is no abhanumber field.
- Note the capital V in /V2/.

### Postconditions

On success the service returns HTTP 200 with ParticipantDeLinkAbhaResponse and the products are no longer visible through the get-policies endpoints for that payer and member. There is no callback. An unauthorised caller is refused with an error message, and a product that is not linked yields "There is no policies with requested details". Other errors use the 400/404/500 ErrorResponse envelope. Provider-side policy caches are documented as permanent, so they will keep the old answer until forced to refresh.

### Common mistakes

- Calling from a participant that is neither the payerid nor the processingid used at link time; NHCX checks the client ID in the token, not the body, and refuses the call (common mistake 10).
- Listing a product that is not actually linked for that payerid and memberid, which returns the error message "There is no policies with requested details".
- Including abhanumber or mobilenumber in the body; the de-link request is keyed on payerid, memberid and the products listed, and has no ABHA field.
- Expecting provider-side caches to update: the handbook documents the policy cache as permanent with no TTL, so a de-linked policy keeps appearing until the provider passes forceRefresh: true.
- Using a token generated with a different client_ID from the one used when the payer or TPA participant was created.
- Lower-casing the path; /v2/participant/delink/abha/policy is not a documented route.

### Best practices

- De-link only the specific products that need removing; the policies array is the unit of work.
- When moving an insurer to a new TPA, follow the documented order: de-link the existing policies, then link them again with the new TPA's participant code as processingid.
- Generate a fresh UUID for requestid on every call and log it with the response.
- Confirm the result with /participant/get/policies afterwards, and remember that providers may need a forced refresh of their own policy cache.
- Refresh the Bearer token proactively and retry once on 401 before escalating.

### Related scenario

A TPA is informed by one of its insurers that a corporate group policy has been cancelled mid-term. The TPA's system lists the affected members from its own records, calls /V2/participant/get/policies to confirm what NHCX currently holds, and then calls /V2/participant/delink/abha/policy per member with the insurer's participant code as payerid, its own code as processingid and the cancelled product. Each success is logged against the member. When a former member later presents at a hospital, the provider's policy lookup (after a forced cache refresh) no longer shows the product, and the desk proceeds as a self-pay case rather than submitting a coverage-eligibility check.

### Specification

Chapter [Creating and updating a participant](/docs/nhcx/v1/getting-started/creating-and-updating-a-participant) of the NHCX integration specification.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice/V2/participant/delink/abha/policy \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSIONS_CALL>' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <access token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "requestid": "c4d2e1f0-8b7a-4c6d-9e5f-1a2b3c4d5e66",
  "payerid": "100234@sbx",

```

## Authorization

- `Authorization` (bearer token, required): On every NHCX call, the token goes in a header called `bearer_auth`, with the word `Bearer` and a space in front. The sources are not unanimous: the authentication page and the FAQ both write the example as `Authorization`, and the notification endpoint uses `Authorization`. The safe course, and what the adapter does, is to send both headers with the same value.

## Headers

- `bearer_auth` (string, required): It is `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`, on NHCX's own endpoints.

## Body

- `requestid` (string)
- `payerid` (string)
- `memberid` (string)
- `policies` (object[])
- `policies.productid` (string)
- `policies.productname` (string)
- `processingid` (string)

## Responses

- `200`: On success the service returns HTTP 200 with ParticipantDeLinkAbhaResponse and the products are no longer visible through the get-policies endpoints for that payer and member.
