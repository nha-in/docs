# Troubleshooting

A symptom-first chapter. Everything else in this documentation is organised by what you are building; this one is organised by what has gone wrong, because that is the only thing you know at the moment you need it.

## Isolate the layer first

A message crosses five layers on its way to a decision, and each one refuses in a different way. Work out which layer stopped it before you look anything up, because the same symptom means different things at different layers.

| Layer           | What refuses                       | How you hear                                    | Code family                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1. Transport    | Your HTTP call to the gateway      | Synchronously, in the response to your own call | HTTP `4xx`, `5xx`                     |
| 2. Gateway      | The exchange, reading the envelope | Synchronously, or later on `/v1/error`          | `NHCX-1xxx`                           |
| 3. Encryption   | The recipient, opening the letter  | On your callback, as a protocol response        | `PAYR-1001`, `PAYR-1002`, `PAYR-1097` |
| 4. Bundle       | The recipient, validating FHIR     | On your callback, inside the sealed response    | `PAYR-10xx`                           |
| 5. Adjudication | The payer's rules                  | On your callback, inside the sealed response    | `PAYR-11xx` to `PAYR-14xx`            |

The layers are strictly ordered. Reaching a layer means every layer before it passed, which is why a scheme-rule refusal is good news about your bundle.

## When nothing arrives on your callback

The commonest report, and it is almost always one of six things. The portal lists the first five; the sixth is the one people miss.

1. **The address.** A domain name, not an IP address and not a port number.
2. **The location.** The server must be hosted in India.
3. **The firewall.** Allow the exchange's outbound addresses: `3.109.99.210`, `13.126.152.0`, `13.200.129.223`.
4. **The rules.** Check nothing else is dropping the inbound connection.
5. **Application routing.** The request reaches the server and is dispatched to the wrong handler by a mismatched route, a load balancer rule or a version prefix.
6. **The receipt.** You answered, but not with `202` and the receipt body within 30 seconds. A slow `200` is read as a failed delivery. After five attempts the exchange gives up and retires the correlation ID, and tells you on `/v1/error`, which you must also be hosting.

Test the whole path rather than the parts. Call your own registered public address from outside your network and confirm that what answers is the service you think it is.

## When a case has gone quiet

In order, and stop at the first that explains it.

1. **Did you get a receipt?** No receipt means the exchange never took the message. It is not a payer problem.
2. **Did anything arrive on `/v1/error`?** That is where an undeliverable request is reported. A system without the endpoint never learns.
3. **Ask the exchange.** The status exchange reports where a message got to. Status and Search in Getting Started has the shape.
4. **Under PMJAY, ask the payer service.** A case sits at `request.initiated` until someone acts on it in the scheme's own system. The role lookup says where it is. PMJAY Adjudication APIs has it.
5. **Only then treat it as slow.** The scheme decides on its own schedule. An enhancement approved in a minute on one run was still queued five minutes on in another, with the same bundle.

## Things that look like faults and are not

- **A queued acknowledgement.** Both live payers answer twice on one correlation: an interim response saying the request is with an adjudicator, then the decision. Treat the first as an acknowledgement, not as the answer.
- **`outcome: complete` on a rejection.** `complete` means the payer finished processing. The adjudication reason is what separates approval from rejection.
- **A reduced amount without `partial`.** The reference payer approves at a lower figure and still sends `complete` with no note. Reconcile amounts yourself.
- **Zero benefit on a query.** It means no benefit has been determined yet, not that the claim was refused.
- **A base rate of zero in the plan.** Some packages are priced entirely by the bed category chosen.
- **`PAYR-1238` on a preauthorisation.** It arrives only after the bundle has passed validation, so it is the first evidence the bundle is right.
- **A `SUBSETTED` meta tag.** Every payer-generated bundle carries it. It marks a projection of the payer's record, not an error.

## Before you raise it with support

Have these to hand. Every one of them is something the exchange or the payer will ask for, and a report without them cannot be traced.

- The correlation ID, and the API call ID of the specific message.
- The timestamp, and which environment.
- Your participant code and the recipient's.
- The workflow code and the status word you sent.
- The raw sealed message as sent, and the raw response as received. Store both before you interpret either; this is the only reason that instruction is repeated throughout this documentation.
- The error code and the payer's message verbatim, not your rendering of it.
