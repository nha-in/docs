# D3. patient

#### D3T. TABLE
One row is one registered patient; primary key `id`; parent table [D1. organization](D1-organization.md) (`managing_org_id`).

#### D3D. DESCRIPTION
The patient register. A claim is linked to a patient through the admission: the claim's ABHA number is compared digits-only with `abha_number` here, and the patient of the chosen current IPD stay is written to [D9. claim](D9-claim.md) `patient_id`.

Once linked, the claim-side bundles take the patient from this row, falling back to what the payer returned on the claim:
- eligibility check: `given_name` (else the claim's `beneficiary_name`), `family_name`, `gender`, `birth_date`, `mrn` (as `patientRefId`, else `NA`), `district`, `state`, `phone`.
- pre-auth and claim: `name`, `gender`, `birth_date`, `phone`.

Lifecycle:
- Created from the registration form (S14). `name` and `phone` are mandatory ("Name and mobile number are mandatory."). On create the application allocates `mrn` from the `mrn` counter as `MRN` plus five digits (`MRN00001`) [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers), stamps `created_at` and `updated_at`, and sets `managing_org_id` to the facility row. `gender` falls back to `unknown`; `country` is always written as `India`.
- Updated from the same form: every form field is overwritten and `updated_at` is stamped. `mrn` and `managing_org_id` do not change.
- No screen deletes a patient or sets `deceased`. Rows are removed only by the "clear transactional data" reset, which deletes every patient row and the counters.
