# F3. CoverageEligibilityResponse

#### F3R. RESOURCE
`CoverageEligibilityResponse`. Direction: sent on `v1/coverageeligibility/on_check` by A1. Eligibility Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer), answering C2. Coverage Eligibility Check (in nhcx-coverage/payer) on the request's correlation id. `meta.profile` is the base R4 profile `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CoverageEligibilityResponse`, which is what the scheme payer declares [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); the NRCeS profile is not claimed. Every resource carries the `SUBSETTED` tag (F1).

#### F3D. DESCRIPTION
The answer to F2, built at once from the enrolment the request's handles matched ([D6. subscription](../database/D6-subscription.md), [D5. member](../database/D5-member.md), [D12. policy](../database/D12-policy.md)). The bundle first echoes the hospital's request entries as they came, then appends this payer's own entries under one anchor, in this order: the CoverageEligibilityResponse, the Patient (F15), the Coverage (F18), the payer Organization and, when the request named a facility, the hospital Organization (F17). A hospital reads the **last** resource of each type as the payer's, so the order matters [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**What the purpose decides.** The `purpose` list is echoed (`validation` when the request carried none):

| Purpose | `insurance[0].item[]` |
|---|---|
| `discovery` alone | none: the cover, and nothing else |
| `validation`, or `benefits` / `auth-requirements` with no items | one admission item (SNOMED `305056002` "Admission procedure") carrying the money |
| `benefits` with items | one item per package asked about, with the package rate |
| `auth-requirements` with items | one item per package, with the rate, every document due at any stage and the treatment-guideline form |

**In force, lapsed, exhausted.** `insurance[0].inforce` and the `disposition` come from the enrolment's standing on the day, in these words: not active gives `false`, "Cover is <status>. No benefit is payable while the subscription is not active."; before the period `false`, "Cover does not begin until <start>."; after it `false`, "Cover lapsed on <end>."; a zero wallet `true`, "Policy is in force until <end>. The sum insured is exhausted; no balance remains."; otherwise `true`, "Policy is in force until <end>. INR <balance> of cover remains." An enrolment found only among lapsed ones is still answered, so the hospital learns why rather than "no such person" (A1. Eligibility Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer)).

**The money on a validation.** Two benefits on the admission item, and the hospital reads the one typed `benefit` as the wallet [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers):
- typed `30` "Health Benefit Plan Coverage" (`http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/ex-benefitcategory`): `allowedMoney` the sum assured (`D12.total_assured`), `usedMoney` sum assured minus the wallet balance;
- typed `benefit` "Benefit" (`http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/benefit-type`): `allowedMoney` what is left (`D6.wallet_balance`), `usedMoney` the same used figure.
`authorizationRequired` is always `true`: this payer wants to see every case before money is committed [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Per package.** A package is found on the policy by this payer's own code first, then by its SNOMED or ICD-10-PCS coding ([D10. procedure_rule](../database/D10-procedure-rule.md), [D13. policy_procedure](../database/D13-policy-procedure.md)). Not on the policy: `excluded: true`, no benefit, no requirements. Covered: the registry's own code and name replace the hospital's spelling, the category is the registry's (the hospital's category code kept when it sent one), `authorizationRequired: true`, `excluded: false`, one benefit typed `Procedure` with `allowedMoney` the package rate when one is set (`D10.package_rate`; null is "not priced" and gives no benefit), and `authorizationSupporting[]`.

**`authorizationSupporting[]` text conventions** [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The profile gives no place to say when a document is due, so the stage rides on the concept's `text`, exactly as the scheme writes it and as hospital readers parse it: one concept per required document, `coding[0]` the document code and name ([D11. procedure_rule_doc](../database/D11-procedure-rule-doc.md), [D3. document_type](../database/D3-document-type.md)), `text` `Type: <stage>\n Procedure Code:<package code>`. The stage is `pre` for documents wanted at pre-authorisation and `post` for those wanted at discharge or claim. A `benefits` answer lists the `pre` documents only; an `auth-requirements` answer lists every stage and then the treatment-guideline form as one more concept, `coding[0]` the Questionnaire id and title, `text` `fullUrl: <questionnaire url>` (F6). Duplicates on one stage and code are written once. The disposition then adds a sentence: "All N requested items are covered; pre-authorisation is required and the documents listed must accompany it.", "None of the N requested items is covered by this policy.", or "K of N requested items are covered; the rest are not on this policy's schedule."

**No cover.** When no enrolment matches any handle, the answer is still sent: `outcome` `complete`, `disposition` "No active cover was found for the details provided.", no `insurance[]`, and a Patient built from what the request said (member id, ABHA, name, mobile) so the response has something to point at. Leaving the enquiry unanswered would keep the hospital polling (A1. Eligibility Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer)).

`outcome` is always `complete` on every answer; the verdict is in `inforce` and the disposition, never in `outcome`.

#### F3F. FIELDS
The response, at `<anchor>/<member id>`:

| Element written | From | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id`, `identifier[0].value` | `<member id>-<facility id>`, or the member id alone | `identifier[0].system` is `<payer base>/v1/coverageeligibility/check` |
| `meta.profile[0]` | `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/CoverageEligibilityResponse` | plus the `SUBSETTED` tag |
| `status` | `active` | |
| `purpose[]` | the request's, else `["validation"]` | |
| `patient.reference` | `<anchor>/patient/<member id>` | |
| `created` | now, IST | |
| `requestor.reference` | `<anchor>/organization/provider/<facility id>` | left out when the request named no facility |
| `request.reference` | `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/coverage-eligibility/request` | the request anchor [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) |
| `outcome` | `complete` | |
| `disposition` | the standing sentence, plus the items sentence | |
| `insurer.reference` | `<anchor>/organization/payer/<payer code without @hcx>` | |
| `insurance[0].coverage.reference` | `<anchor>/coverage/<D6.id><member id>` | |
| `insurance[0].inforce` | the standing | |
| `insurance[0].item[]` | per purpose, above | none on discovery and on no cover |
| `item[].productOrService.coding[0]` | SNOMED admission concept, or `D10.code` / `D10.name` | |
| `item[].category.coding[0]` | `D10.category`, code overridden by the hospital's when sent | packages only |
| `item[].benefit[]` | `30` and `benefit` with `D12.total_assured`, `D6.wallet_balance` (admission); `Procedure` with `D10.package_rate` (package) | `currency` `INR` |
| `item[].authorizationRequired` | `true` | |
| `item[].excluded` | `false`, or `true` for a package not on the policy | packages only |
| `item[].authorizationSupporting[]` | `D11` rows joined to `D3`, `text` `Type: <pre or post>\n Procedure Code:<D10.code>`; the STG form as `fullUrl: <url>` | required documents only |

The Patient, Coverage and Organizations beside it are F15, F18 and F17. Nothing is written to the database by the render; the answer is recorded on the audit log ([D31. audit_log](../database/D31-audit-log.md)) and the checklist by A1. Eligibility Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer).
