# Insurance plan response, package-based

The shape government schemes send, and PMJAY sends throughout. A package is a named procedure at a fixed, all-inclusive rate. The plan carries every package the hospital may bill and the rules that govern each one. Everything in this chapter is what PMJAY specifies.

## Questionnaires

| Title | Items | Item types | Question in |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Discharge Information | 7 | `attachment`, `choice`, `dateTime` | `text` |
| General Findings | 9 | `string`, `choice` | `text` |
| Personal History | 6 | `choice` | `text` |
| Family History | 7 | `choice` | `text` |
| Admission Details | 4 | `dateTime`, `choice` | `text` |

## Rules

### 1. Two parallel structures

`coverage[]` carries the rules: flags, document requirements, questionnaire links and `limit[]` rates. `plan[].specificCost[]` carries the money: `cost[]` lines by type. Both hold the same package codes. Index both by package code and join; neither is complete alone.

### 2. Categories

`coverage[].type` and `specificCost[].category` bind to `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/ValueSet/ndhm-benefitcategory`. Codes beginning `S` are surgical, `M` medical.

### 3. Flags are strings

Every flag except `ParentProcedure` is a `valueString`. `"N"` is truthy in most languages; compare against the literal `"Y"`.

### 4. Cost lines

`Procedure` is the base package rate. `Stratification` is the rate for a ward tier, named in `cost.qualifiers[]`. `Implant` is added over the package rate.

### 5. A zero base rate

A base limit of 0 means the payable amount is set entirely by the ward tier chosen. It is not missing data. Never submit a zero-value item.

### 6. Document requirements come in two shapes

Nested, one sub-extension per document, and flat, with `category`, `code` and `documentationUrl` directly under the extension. Recurse, or one shape is silently dropped.

### 7. Where the question is

Policy-level questionnaires put the question in `item.text`, STG questionnaires in `item.prefix`. Read `text` and fall back to `prefix`.

### 8. Implant codes repeat

Once per parent procedure they may accompany. Key on the package code with its parent, or on the element `id`.

### 9. Extension urls change form

The absolute `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Claim-Condition` and the relative `claim-condition` both occur. Match on the last segment.

## PMJAY

This is the PMJAY shape; the rules above are PMJAY's.
