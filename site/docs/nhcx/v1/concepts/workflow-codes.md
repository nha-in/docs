# Workflow Codes

Endpoints alone do not identify an NHCX transaction. A new preauthorisation, a resubmission, an enhancement and a query response all travel on `/v1/preauth/submit` carrying the same bundle. What separates them is the workflow code in the `x-hcx-workflow_id` header. Each code also expects a particular status word, given here beside it. The source is the official Workflow Status Sheet on the portal, updated 18 August 2026, which remains the authority as codes are added.

The A-series registry and session calls carry no workflow code because they are infrastructure calls rather than claim transactions.

## Workflow Code Prefix Families

NHA organizes workflow codes into numeric mainline cashless codes and alphanumeric families:

| Prefix | Family Name | Scope & Operational Coverage |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **`R`** | **Reimbursement** | Mirrors the numeric cashless codes for the reimbursement route - the patient paid, and is claiming it back. |
| **`G`** | **Grievance** | Raising a grievance, its acknowledgement, and its failure path. |
| **`RP`** | **Return payment** | Money going back the other way. |
| **`N`** | **Notifications** | Push notifications addressed to payer, provider or beneficiary. |
| **`DC`** | **Discharge correction** | Correcting a discharge already submitted. |
| **`PC`** | **Preauth cancellation** | Withdrawing a pre-authorisation. Raised on /v1/task/submit with code `cancel`, not on the preauth endpoint. |

## Mainline Cashless State Machines

In the diagrams below, each arrow carries the workflow code of the message that moves the case.

## Reconciled Discrepancies and Authority Rules

Seven codes are published differently in the PMJAY Handbook and the Workflow Status Sheet, resolved here by taking the Workflow Status Sheet as the definitive authority:

| Code | PMJAY Handbook | Workflow Status Sheet |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`17`** | PAYMENT_RECEIVED, provider-side - "Payment received acknowledgment" | "Payment Notice Recived", response.complete |
| **`24`** | Payer-side response code, PREAUTH_REQUEST_QUERIED | "PreAuth Request Queried", header request.initiated |
| **`27`** | Payer-side response code, CLAIM_REQUEST_QUERIED | "Claim Request Queried", header request.initiated |
| **`30`** | Payer-side, PAYMENT_INITIATED | "Payment Notice Initmation", request.initiated |
| **`31 / 33`** | Payer-side response codes | header request.initiated |
| **`251`** | REPROCESS_REQUEST_RECEIVED | "PreAuth Reprocess Ack" |
| **`36`** | CLAIM_ARBITRATION_REQUEST_SUBMITTED, use case "Reprocess/Erroneous request" | "Claim Arbitration Intimation" |

The same authority settles these conflicts across official NHA publications (Workflow Status Sheet vs PMJAY Handbook vs Value Sets):

1. **251**: Reconciled as Preauthorisation Resubmission acknowledgement in the sheet; the PMJAY handbook uses it in its claim reprocess section.
2. **Cancellation (PC01 vs 122)**: The sheet and handbook code table prescribe `PC01` (request) and `PC02` (completion). The handbook prose mentions `122`, which clashes with `R122` (reimbursement claim reprocess). Integrators should strictly use `PC01` and `PC02` on `/v1/task/submit`.
3. **18**: Defined as Preauthorisation Query Acknowledgement in the sheet; the handbook repurposes it for claim reprocess.
4. **Reprocess (36 vs 18)**: Section 11 gives `18` for reprocess, while Section 12 gives `36` (Claim Arbitration). Integrators should use `36` with task code `reprocess` and reason `claimrejected`.
5. **Shortfall**: Rides on `36` as a Task with code `reprocess` and reason `partialpayment`, raised only after payment notice `33` has arrived and been acknowledged with `17`.
6. **25 and 291**: Named as Claim *Document* acknowledgement and denial in the sheet, and Claim request received and denied in the value sets. Both refer to the same transition.

### Protocol Fault Flags

The source sheet's audit flags mark certain code-and-status pairs as protocol errors rather than normal traffic:
- For `131`, `45`, `47`, and `30`, sending **either** `response.partial` or `response.error` is flagged as an invalid state transition.
- `18` sent with `response.error` is flagged as an invalid terminal state.
- Query `27` sent as `response.partial` or `response.complete` is invalid (must be `request.initiated`).
