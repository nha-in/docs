# Callbacks

Every message NHCX delivers to the application. NHCX posts it to the application's public inbound route (`/in/<path>` or `/v1/<path>`, whichever the registered `endpoint_url` points at); [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) decrypts it and hands it in-process to C1, then records it and C1's outcome in [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md). APIs (A) and screens (S) refer to these by C number. Each file has ENDPOINT (E), DESCRIPTION (D), REQUEST (Q), PSEUDOCODE (P), RESPONSE (S) and USED BY (U) sections.
