# C9. Payer Communication

#### C9E. ENDPOINT
Delivered in-process by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) for NHCX route `v1/communication/request`, passed to `C1.receive` with `delivery.type` `communication`. Payer-initiated: a query is answered by A7 (reply), a notification is acknowledged by A7 automatically, a note takes no answer.

#### C9D. DESCRIPTION
The payer speaking first, on a thread the payer mints, so nothing here waits on the message's correlation id. Three kinds are filed on the case:

| Bundle carries | Filed as | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| a CommunicationRequest, classified as a query | `query`, `open` | the case shows `queried` while the leg is with the payer; the desk answers through A7 |
| a CommunicationRequest, classified as a notification | `notification` | acknowledged at once through A7; the case is untouched |
| a Communication and no CommunicationRequest | `note`, `noted` | shown, never acted on; nothing goes back |

**Classification** (by the sender's payer adapter: `x-hcx-sender_code` when present, else the case's payer; an unknown sender gets the generic adapter; query modes in [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). A `resubmit`-mode payer (PMJAY) queries inside the ClaimResponse (C5, C6), so every CommunicationRequest from it is a notification [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). For a `communication`-mode payer: Task `intent` `proposal` is a notification and `order` a query; with no intent, a Task reason code of empty, `additionalinfo`, `questionnaire` or `query` is a query and anything else a notification [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Matching**, first hit wins:
1. each claim reference the resource names (reference, its last path segment, display, identifier value; from `about`, `basedOn`, `identifier` on a request, plus `inResponseTo` and `partOf` on a note) against the case number (D9 `claim_no`), then the number a leg went out under (D20 `claim_ref`, then D18 `claim_ref`), because a cancel retires a number;
2. each reference against a payer request already held (D23 `request_id`), which also gives the leg;
3. the message's correlation id against any leg (C1 `claim_for_correlation`);
4. `x-hcx-workflow_id` against the claim leg's correlation id (D20), then the pre-authorisation's (D18). This names the leg asked about even when an earlier step found the case, and finds the case when nothing else did.

The leg (`stage`) is the one step 2 or 4 named; otherwise `claim` when a claim has been filed (D20 status not `draft`), else `preauth`.

**Redelivery.** A request whose correlation id is already on a D23 row is `ignored`. A note is `ignored` when the same Communication id is already filed as a note on that case. A `ProtocolResponse` is `ignored`.

Archiving (C1) happens before matching and reads less: only a `CLN`-typed identifier, a display or a reference. A message that names the case some other way (an untyped identifier, or only the workflow id) is filed under the `unmatched` folder even when it settles.

#### C9Q. REQUEST
`fhir` is an F1 TaskBundle: a Task (`code` `poll`, `intent`, `reasonCode`) whose `input` points at an F11 CommunicationRequest, with F17 Organizations and sometimes the Claim, F15 Patient, F16 Practitioner and F18 Coverage it is about. A note carries a Communication instead. Every `payload[].contentString` is one thing asked for.

A policy-wide notification (Task `intent: proposal`, for example reason `policychange`) names no case, so it is usually `unmatched`.

```

A request or note that cannot be read raises `The payer message carries no CommunicationRequest.` / `The payer message carries no Communication.` (`rejected`); in practice the dispatch above only calls each when its resource is present.

#### C9S. RESPONSE
`settled` for a new query, notification or note; `unmatched` when nothing here answers to what it names; `ignored` for a redelivery, a `ProtocolResponse`, or a bundle with neither resource. A failed automatic acknowledgement is still `settled`, so G8 accepts the message.

State changes, D23 claim_query (one new row):

| Kind | `status` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | `open` | D9 `stage` / `sub_stage` restamped: an open query on a leg with the payer shows `queried` |
| `notification` | `acknowledged`, or `error` when the A7 send failed | `reply_txn_id`, `reply_correlation_id`, `acknowledged_at`, `reply_json` |
| `note` | `noted` | `correlation_id` left empty when an earlier row already holds that thread |

The pre-authorisation (D18) and claim (D20) legs themselves are not written.
