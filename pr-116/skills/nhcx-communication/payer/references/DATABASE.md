# Database

Every table behind the desk, the registry, the products and the payments, in one list. Each row links to its full spec in [../database/](../database/INDEX.md), which gives the columns, keys and indexes. D1 to D18 are tables most payer systems already have (extended where NHCX needs a field); D19 to D32 are new for the cases, the exchange and the payments.
