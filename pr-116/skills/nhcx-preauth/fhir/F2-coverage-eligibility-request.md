# F2. CoverageEligibilityRequest

#### F2R. RESOURCE
`CoverageEligibilityRequest`, profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/CoverageEligibilityRequest`, inside a bundle with profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/CoverageEligibilityRequestBundle` (F1). Direction: sent.

#### F2D. DESCRIPTION
One bundle shape serves all four purposes. The bundle has seven entries, always in this order:

| # | `fullUrl` | Resource | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/coverage-eligibility/request` | CoverageEligibilityRequest | this file |
| 2 | `.../patient` | Patient: the member id only | F15 |
| 3 | `.../provider` | Organization, the facility | F17 |
| 4 | `.../payer` | Organization, the payer | F17 |
| 5 | `.../location` | Location | F19 |
| 6 | `.../coverage` | Coverage | F18 |
| 7 | `.../practitioner-role` | PractitionerRole, the enterer | F16 |

No resource carries an `id`. The bundle `id` is `coverage-<purpose without hyphens>-request-generic`.

Purposes:

| `purpose` | Sent when | Coverage identifier (F18) | `item[]` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `validation` | the eligibility check: is the policy in force | the policy code (required) | none |
| `benefits` | the eligibility check: what the policy covers for the quoted packages | the policy code (required) | the quoted lines, when there are any |
| `discovery` | the eligibility check, policy not yet known | the policy code if entered, else `NONE` | none |
| `auth-requirements` | the procedure-set ruling, by the operator or automatically before a pre-authorisation or enhancement | the case's policy code, else `NONE` | the quoted lines (at least one) |

Rules:
- Patient demographics are never sent. The payer returns them (F3).
- An `item` names a package and nothing else: no money, no diagnosis, no sequence.
- One `item` per procedure or implant line. A ward or ICU tier (stratification line) is not an item. It rides as a `modifier` on the procedure it was quoted through [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers): the procedure whose code is the tier's `parent_code`, else the first procedure whose plan costs offer that tier, else the first procedure. A tier with no procedure to ride on goes as an item of its own.
- `quantity` is sent as a whole number when it is whole (`1`, not `1.0`).
- The builder refuses a bundle without a member id ("A coverage check needs the member id to ask about."), without the facility registry id ("A coverage check needs the facility's registry id.") or without a payer code ("A coverage check needs the payer's participant code."), and any other purpose ("'<purpose>' is not a coverage eligibility purpose.").
