# F10. Task (claim actions and answers)

#### F10R. RESOURCE
`Task`, in both directions.

- **Received** on `v1/task/submit` (cancel, reprocess, release, status), on `v1/status` or headers-only (status), and on `v1/paymentnotice/on_request` (the payment acknowledgement). No profile is checked. Read by [C7. Task Submit](../callbacks/C7-task-submit.md), [C8. Status Enquiry](../callbacks/C8-status-enquiry.md) and C11. Payment Acknowledgement (in nhcx-payment/payer). A Task asking for a plan is not this resource: it is [F4. Task (InsurancePlan request)](F4-task-insuranceplan.md).
- **Sent** on `v1/task/on_submit` (the answer to a cancel, a reprocess or a release, and to a status Task sent on the task route) and on `v1/on_status` (the answer to a status ask on the status route), by [A9. Task Answer](../apis/A9-task-answer.md) and [A8. Status Answer](../apis/A8-status-answer.md). The shape is the scheme's own answer to a Task [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers): a Task coded `approve` when the payer did what was asked and `reject` when it could not, its output an `include` pointing at a ClaimResponse ([F9. ClaimResponse](F9-claimresponse.md)) that says where the case now stands, with the Patient, both Organizations and the Coverage beside it.

#### F10D. DESCRIPTION
**Received.** The first `Task` in the bundle that is not a plan request. What it asks is its `code` on `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/financialtaskcode` (the first coding of any system when none names that one):

| `code` | Means | Handled by | Answered |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cancel` | withdraw the pre-authorisation | [C7. Task Submit](../callbacks/C7-task-submit.md) | yes, [A9. Task Answer](../apis/A9-task-answer.md), workflow PC02 |
| `reprocess` | look at a decided claim again | [C7. Task Submit](../callbacks/C7-task-submit.md) | acknowledged at once, then decided on this thread ([A9. Task Answer](../apis/A9-task-answer.md)) |
| `release` | pay the balance of a partly paid claim; the amount asked for rides as the `amount` input | [C7. Task Submit](../callbacks/C7-task-submit.md) | as reprocess |
| `status` (no `paymentack` output) | where does this thread stand | [C8. Status Enquiry](../callbacks/C8-status-enquiry.md) | yes, [A8. Status Answer](../apis/A8-status-answer.md) |
| any code with output `status` = `paymentack` | the hospital saw this payer's payment notice | C11. Payment Acknowledgement (in nhcx-payment/payer) | no |

A status enquiry may arrive with no bundle at all: the HCX shape carries only `x-hcx-status_filters` in the protected header, and the envelope alone is then read as a status Task ([C1. Callback Door](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md)). The filter names the thread being asked about: its `x-hcx-correlation_id` (or `correlation_id`), `x-hcx-workflow_id` (or `workflow_id`) and `claim_number` (or `claimNumber`, `x-hcx-claim_number`); each fills its slot only when a Task input did not.

The claim the Task is about is its identifier typed `CLN`, else the first input or output typed `claimNumber`, `intimationNumber`, `initimationNumber` (the misspelling some builders send) or `CLN`. A cancel's `reasonCode` (display, else code) and `description` become the reason on the timeline.

**Sent.** The answer is rendered whichever way the case went. `status` is `completed` when the payer did what was asked (a cancel accomplished, a reprocess decided), `accepted` when it took the request in for a person to decide (the reprocess acknowledgement), `rejected` when it could not (a closed case, no such claim). The code is `approve` "Activate/approve the focal resource" unless the status is `rejected`, then `reject` "Reject the focal resource", on `http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/task-code`. `description` is a line for a person: the outcome of the reprocess, why a cancel was refused, "No submission on that thread is on record with this payer." on an unknown status ask.

When a case matched, `output[0]` is an `include` (`http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/financialtaskinputtype`) pointing at a ClaimResponse in the same bundle: `use` by the leg the case is on (`claim` at stage claim, payment or settled, else `preauthorization`), `outcome` and the claim-level `status` adjudication from the case (a withdrawn case reads `complete` and `cancelled`, as the scheme's cancellation does), the `benefit` and `submitted` totals, and the description as `disposition`. The Patient carries the member identifier alone ([F15. Patient](F15-patient.md)), the Organizations both parties ([F17. Organization](F17-organization.md)), the Coverage the enrolment ([F18. Coverage](F18-coverage.md)). When nothing matched, the Task names the two parties and carries no ClaimResponse, Patient or Coverage; an issue in the render result says so.

A status answer also carries the protocol header `x-hcx-status_response` beside the bundle, which is what the hospital reads first ([A8. Status Answer](../apis/A8-status-answer.md)): `entity_type` (`preauth` or `claim`), `entity_status` (the case's stage and decision as one code, for example `preauth-pending`, `claim-queried`, `payment-partial`, `settled`, `cancelled`, `not-found`), `claim_no`, `stage`, `outcome`, `total_claimed`, `total_approved`, `total_paid`, `answered`.

Every resource sent is tagged `SUBSETTED` on `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationValue`; every entry's `id` is its `fullUrl` under `<base>/v1/task/on_submit`, the bundle a `collection` identified by the hospital's claim number ([F1. Bundle](F1-bundle.md)).
