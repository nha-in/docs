# D21. case_procedure

#### D21T. TABLE
One row is one procedure on one case ([D19. case](D19-case.md)), as the hospital coded it; primary key `(case_id, code)`. The reference implementation names it `payer_case_procedures` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D21D. DESCRIPTION
What the hospital says it did or intends to do, read from the Procedure resources and the package items of the Claim bundle ([F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md), [F19. Other resources](../fhir/F19-other-resources.md)): the code, the name, and the category and clinical codings when sent. It is the hospital's statement, kept beside the registry's own procedure ([D10. procedure_rule](D10-procedure-rule.md)) rather than joined to it: a hospital may bill a package this payer has never heard of, and the adjudicator has to see that it did.

The predetermination rules ([A10. Predetermination Quote](../apis/A10-predetermination-quote.md)) and the desk ([S3. Case Desk](../screens/S3-case-desk.md)) match `code` against the member's product ([D13. policy_procedure](D13-policy-procedure.md)) to say whether the procedure is covered and at what rate.

Create:
- Written with the case by [C4. Pre-auth Submit](../callbacks/C4-preauth-submit.md) (C5. Claim Submit (in nhcx-claim/payer) for a direct claim), in the order sent, or from the desk's own case form [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Cascade with the case; never edited on their own.
