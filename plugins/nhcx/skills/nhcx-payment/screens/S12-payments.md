# S12. Payments Screen

#### S12R. ROUTE
claims/view/:caseid/payments

This is the Payments tab of the Claim Detail shell S6. Its route is `claims/view/:caseid/payments`.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST claims/:caseid/payments/:pid/ack` | Send a payment notice's acknowledgement (again) |

Breadcrumb: Claims (claims/list, S5) > `<claim number>`

#### S12D. DESCRIPTION
Every payment notice the payer has sent about this claim, newest first. The payer starts this leg, not the hospital. There is nothing to submit here. The only action is re-sending an acknowledgement that failed.

**Intro card.** The card is titled "Payments" and reads: "The payer starts this leg: it posts a **payment notice** when money moves, typically one when payment is initiated and another when it clears, matched to this claim by the `CLN` number inside it. Each is acknowledged back automatically the moment it lands."

Below the text are three stat tiles:

| Tile | Value | Tone |
|---|---|---|
| Notices | Count of notices on the claim | info |
| Paid so far | Paid total (see below) | success when above zero |
| Claimed | The claim's requested amount, `-` before a claim is filed | default |

**Empty state.** When no notice has arrived, a centred placeholder with an inbox icon reads: "No payment notice yet. One arrives from NHCX when the payer moves money for this claim."

**One card per notice.**
- **Title:** the notice's disposition. When there is none, the title is "Payment notice".
- **Chips:**
  - **Payment status chip.** When the notice only announces an initiated payment (no UTR yet and a disposition containing "initiat" [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)), the chip reads "Initiated, UTR awaited" in the warning tone. Otherwise it shows the payer's payment status code, coloured as follows:

    | Payment status | Tone |
    |---|---|
    | `paid`, `cleared` | success |
    | `issued` | info |
    | `pending`, `partial` | warning |
    | `failed`, `returned` | danger |
    | anything else | info |

  - **Acknowledgement chip:**

    | Ack status | Label | Tone |
    |---|---|---|
    | `pending` | Not acknowledged | warning |
    | `sent` | Acknowledged | success |
    | `error` | Acknowledgement failed | danger |

- **Detail list** (three columns): Amount, Currency, Payment date, UTR, Claim number (the `CLN` the notice named), Received, Acknowledged.
- **Breakdown table.** Shown when the reconciliation carries detail lines. Columns: Reference, Type (display, else code), Date, Amount.
- **Acknowledgement error.** When the last acknowledgement failed, its error text is shown in red.
- **Header action.** When the acknowledgement is not `sent`, a primary button with a check icon. It reads "Acknowledge" when pending and "Acknowledge again" after an error.

Callback: [C10. Payment Notice](../callbacks/C10-paymentnotice-request.md)

**Repeat and new notices.**
- **A later notice for the same payment.** Such a notice (same notice id on the same claim) updates the earlier notice instead of adding one: new values, a fresh breakdown, and the acknowledgement reset to `pending`. It is then acknowledged again on the new thread.
- **A new notice.** A new notice adds a card and recomputes the case's stage. With any notice, the case is at stage Payment, sub-stage "Paid" when the paid total is above zero, otherwise "Notice received".

**Automatic acknowledgement.** Every notice is acknowledged the moment it lands.

API: [A8. Payment Notice Acknowledgement](../apis/A8-paymentnotice-on-request.md)

A failed acknowledgement never rejects the notice:
- The notice is recorded.
- The notice keeps the acknowledgement status `error` with the message, and the card offers "Acknowledge again".

**Manual acknowledgement.** The route answers the not found page ("Payment notice") when the notice does not belong to this claim. On success it flashes "Payment acknowledged to the payer." and returns to S12. Otherwise it flashes the send error from [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md) in red. A missing facility setup gives "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings first."

**Paid total.** "Paid so far", the S6 header chip "Paid ₹X", the balance on the S11 release form and the "paid in full" checks all use the same sum. The rules are:
- Only notices whose status is `paid` or `cleared` count.
- A notice that only announces an initiated payment does not count.
- Each UTR is counted once, and the newest notice for that UTR wins. PMJAY sends one notice on initiation and another on clearing, both stamped `paid` for the full amount [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Adding them up would double the total.
- A notice with no UTR counts under its own id.

The result is rounded to 2 decimals.

**Wallet balance.** This is a different figure. It is not shown on this tab. It appears as the "Wallet balance" tile on the Eligibility tab's Payer verdict (S6). It is computed as the allowed amount minus the used amount, with a missing used amount counted as 0. It is empty (`-`) when the payer reported no allowed amount. The tile is green when the policy is eligible and red when it is not. It comes from the coverage eligibility answer, not from payment notices.

Data: [D9. claim](../database/D9-claim.md)

Data: [D20. claim_submission](../database/D20-claim-submission.md)

Data: [D21. claim_payment](../database/D21-claim-payment.md)

Data: [D22. claim_payment_detail](../database/D22-claim-payment-detail.md)

**Header signals in S6.**
- The "Paid ₹X" chip appears once the paid total is above zero.
- The Next buttons offer "Acknowledge the payment notice" while any notice's acknowledgement is `pending` or `error`. Otherwise they offer "Settled".
- Before any notice arrives, a decided claim offers "Await the payment notice".

#### S12L. LAYOUT
The arrangement below is the reference implementation's [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers): follow the target HMIS's own screen conventions. What is required is in DESCRIPTION and ACTIONS: the fields, options, columns, statuses, messages and actions.

```

- The intro card comes first, then one card per notice, newest first.
- With no notice, the intro card is followed by a card holding the empty-state placeholder.
- The stat tiles sit in three columns from small screens up.
- The chips sit in a wrapping row at the top of each notice card.
- The acknowledge button sits in the card header, right-aligned.

#### S12A. ACTIONS
1. Acknowledge / Acknowledge again: send the payment acknowledgement for that notice and reload S12, where the chip shows "Acknowledged" or the error.
2. Refresh (S6 header, when shown): reload S6 on this tab. Notices arrive pushed through the callback door, so a reload shows new ones.
3. Next "Acknowledge the payment notice" (S6 header): come to this tab.
4. Claim tab: go to Claim Submission S11, for example to ask for the unpaid balance.
5. Breadcrumb "Claims": go to the Claim Master S5.
