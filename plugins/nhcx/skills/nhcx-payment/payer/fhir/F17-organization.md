# F17. Organization

#### F17R. RESOURCE
`Organization`. Direction: **sent** in every outbound bundle, as this payer and as the hospital the message is addressed to; **received** in every hospital bundle, read only for the facility's registry id, name and phone. The profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Organization` is declared on the plan and query family (F5, F11); the case-answer family carries the `SUBSETTED` tag instead (F1).

#### F17D. DESCRIPTION
Three builders, because the two families write the payer differently [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers):

| Where | This payer | The hospital |
|---|---|---|
| Case answers (F3, F9, F10, F13): at `<anchor>/organization/payer/<payer id>` and `<anchor>/organization/provider/<facility id>` | typed `pay` "Payer", identifier `NIIP` "National Insurance Payor Identifier (Payor)" on `https://facility.abdm.gov.in`, `active` `true`, `name` (left off on the payment notice, as the scheme leaves it off); F3 adds the phone under `contact[0].telecom` | typed `prov` "Healthcare Provider", identifier `NPI` "National provider identifier" on the same system, `name` the hospital's name else its id |
| Plan (F5): at `urn:uuid:` | typed `ins` "Insurance Company", identifiers `ROHINI` (ndhm-identifier-type-code, system `https://rohini.iib.gov.in/`) and `PRN` "Provider number" (v2-0203, system `https://irdai.gov.in`) when the payer record holds them, `telecom` phone and email, `address` | not sent |
| Query (F11): at `urn:uuid:` | the plan builder's Organization without its address | typed `prov`, identifier `PRN` on `https://facility.ndhm.gov.in` holding the HFR id |

`https://facility.abdm.gov.in` is what the scheme writes; the hospital side sends `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in` on its own Organizations and checks neither [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**The payer id.** The identifier value in the case-answer family is this payer's participant code without its `@hcx` suffix, taken from the code the message is sent as (the recipient code of the request it answers, `D19.nhcx_recipient_code`), else `D1.nhcx_participant_id`, else `D1.code` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The insurer Organization of the plan family is identified by name alone when neither the ROHINI id nor the IRDAI registration is recorded, and the render says so (S12. Organisation (in nhcx-coverage/payer) is where they are entered).

**The facility id.** `D19.hospital_hfr_id` as the hospital declared it on its Claim; on an eligibility answer the `NPI` identifier of the request's provider Organization; when neither is known, the numeric part of the hospital's participant code, so the anchor still resolves [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). A case with no facility id and no recipient is rendered with an unidentified hospital and a warning.

**Received.** A hospital's bundle names itself and this payer as Organizations. This payer reads the one typed `prov` (else the one the Claim's `provider` or the request's `provider` points at) for its `NPI` or `PRN` identifier value (the HFR id, kept as `D19.hospital_hfr_id`), its `name` (`D19.hospital_name`) and, on an eligibility request, its phone, which the answer echoes on the hospital Organization. The payer Organization a hospital sends is not read: this payer knows who it is. A reply addressed to a code this payer does not host is not opened at all ([G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md)).
