# D10. procedure_rule

#### D10T. TABLE
One row is one procedure (package) in the payer's registry: what it is, what it pays, and the clinical questions asked before it is authorised; primary key `id`, which is the procedure code itself. No parent table. The reference implementation names it `payer_procedure_rules` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D10D. DESCRIPTION
The procedure master the plan and the rulings are built from. A policy names the procedures it covers ([D13. policy_procedure](D13-policy-procedure.md)) and inherits the rules from here rather than copying them, so a document requirement is stated once.

What NHCX reads from the row:
- `package_rate` is the `Procedure` cost the InsurancePlan quotes under `plan.specificCost` ([F5. InsurancePlan](../fhir/F5-insuranceplan.md)) and the allowed amount an auth-requirements ruling answers per item ([F3. CoverageEligibilityResponse](../fhir/F3-coverage-eligibility-response.md), A1. Eligibility Answer (in nhcx-coverage/payer)). Null is "not priced", which is not the same as free: the procedure is listed on the plan without a rate, and the plan preview (S11. FHIR Preview (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) reports it.
- `stg_questions` become the treatment-guideline Questionnaire the plan hangs off the package ([F6. Questionnaire](../fhir/F6-questionnaire.md)), one required free-text item per question with `linkId` `<code>/stg/<n>`, which the ruling points the hospital at. A procedure with none falls back to one yes/no question per document wanted at pre-authorisation ([D11. procedure_rule_doc](D11-procedure-rule-doc.md)), never the discharge summary or the final bill, which nobody has at that stage.
- `snomed_code` and `pcs10_code` identify the procedure to whoever reads the plan; `category` groups it.

Create:
- From the Procedure Configurator (S9. Procedure Configurator (in nhcx-coverage/payer)) through `POST procedures`. The code is the identifier: underwriters quote it on the policy schedule and hospitals send it on the claim, so `id` and `code` are the same upper-cased value and no second id is invented [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The document rules ([D11. procedure_rule_doc](D11-procedure-rule-doc.md)) are written in the same transaction.
- Refused when the code is taken ("A procedure with that code is already in the registry") or a document code named in the rules is not in [D3. document_type](D3-document-type.md).

Update:
- `PATCH procedures/:id`: every column but the id; the document rules are deleted and rewritten.

Delete:
- Soft: `deleted_at` set. Refused while a live policy still covers it ("still referenced"), because a policy that lost a procedure quietly would start declining claims it was sold to pay.
