# A3. Insurance Plan Request

#### A3E. ENDPOINT
In-process: `gateway.send("v1/insuranceplan/request", envelope)`, [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md). G7 encrypts and posts it to NHCX: `POST {nhcx}/v1/insuranceplan/request`. The payer answers asynchronously with `v1/insuranceplan/on_request`, taken in by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) and handed to the callback door C1 (type `insurance`), or found by polling the [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md) (A10 to A13).

#### A3D. DESCRIPTION
Asks the payer for its package master (the InsurancePlan) for this policy and this facility: every empanelled speciality, the packages under it, their rates, ward and implant tiers, claim conditions, the documents each package needs and the questionnaires those documents point at. It is the only exchange whose request carries no clinical content: a discovery `Task` naming a policy number and the facility's HFR ID.

A master belongs to a facility and a policy, not to one case. So on a first fetch the app first looks for a `ready` master already held on another case with the same payer, the same policy code and the same facility HFR ID. When there is one, the newest is copied onto this case with its packages and forms and no request goes out. "Fetch again" (refresh) always asks the payer. A full scheme master runs to tens of megabytes [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

JWE headers: the app sets only these three; G7 generates the rest ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)).
- `x-hcx-sender_code`: the facility's NHCX participant code.
- `x-hcx-recipient_code`: the case's `processing_id`, else its `payer_id`, else the configured default payer code.
- `x-hcx-workflow_id`: the case number [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). It is also how the case finds the exchange again, since the Task itself names no case. Confirm the value against the knowledge source (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)).

Refused before any call:
- "Claim not found."
- "Set the facility's HFR ID under Settings before fetching a package master."
- "Set the facility's NHCX participant code under Settings before fetching a package master."
- with neither a policy code nor an HFR ID: "A plan request needs a policy code or the facility's HFR ID."

#### A3Q. REQUEST

The envelope's fields are the arguments passed to G7 Send.

| Field | Type | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jwe_headers.x-hcx-sender_code` | string | yes | facility participant code |
| `jwe_headers.x-hcx-recipient_code` | string | yes | payer participant code |
| `jwe_headers.x-hcx-workflow_id` | string | yes | case number [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) |
| `fhir` | object | yes | a Task bundle naming the policy number (when the case has one) and the facility HFR ID |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md), [F4. Task (InsurancePlan discovery)](../fhir/F4-task-insuranceplan.md)

Envelope, from a case file:

```json
{
 "jwe_headers": {
  "x-hcx-sender_code": "<facility code>",
  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<payer code>",
  "x-hcx-workflow_id": "NM-26-0SH000004"
 },
 "fhir": <F1 Bundle carrying one F4 Task (policyNumber POL7UMU001, providerId IN1910000151)>
}
```

#### A3S. RESPONSE
Acknowledgement: the G7 result, `{"ok": true, "gateway_status": 202, "txn_id": "...", "correlation_id": "...", "request_id": "...", "headers": {...}, "response": ...}`. The plan goes to `fetching` under its ids (`txn_id`, `correlation_id`) and every earlier result is cleared. A refetch deletes the case's stored packages before the answer lands, so a stale package cannot survive. A failed send that names its ids keeps them and sets the plan to `error` (shared convention).

Plan statuses: `fetching` (Awaiting payer), `ready`, `empty` (No plan returned), `error`.

Data: [D10. claim_plan](../database/D10-claim-plan.md), [D11. claim_plan_benefit](../database/D11-claim-plan-benefit.md), [D12. claim_plan_form](../database/D12-claim-plan-form.md)

Reply: [C4. Insurance Plan Reply](../callbacks/C4-insuranceplan-on-request.md)

- A failed dispatch comes back from G7 at once as a failed send. While polling, a failed dispatch read from the G9 ledger (A11) or a transaction G9 no longer holds (A10) sets the plan to `error`.
