# P4 test case matrix

Every case in NHA's P4 workbook, in the order the sheet groups them, with its marking and its Expected Result. Before building, read it and build each mandatory case's Expected Result for your entity type into the app screen. The test run uses it to know what each case exercises.

Marking is for a government and a private entity, as `abdm_report.py plan` reads the workbook. Mandatory cases come first in each group. 42 cases; 41 mandatory for at least one entity type.

NHA's PHR sheet has no APIs column, so no case names its calls. Read the P specification and journeys for the calls a case's steps imply.
