description: Use when building, debugging or testing ABDM P1, the patient side of Milestone 1: registration in a PHR application, the four login routes, profile management, the ABHA card, and the family members a user manages. Carries the endpoints, the required headers, every recorded error code and the account rules.

# ABDM P1, PHR identity and profile

Generated from the ABDM Developer Portal on 2026-09-14, catalogue version 2026.08.24. Every fact below comes from a page in that portal, which is the place to look when this file does not carry enough.

This file is a snapshot. Re-download it from the portal's /skills/abdm-p1/SKILL.md path when it is older than the work you are doing.
If the abdm-docs MCP server is connected, trust its answers over this file: it serves the current catalogue and stamps every response with its catalogue_version, which you can compare against the version above.

## What this skill covers

- **Scaffold.** Build it flow by flow against the sandbox, as a loop that ends on an observed result rather than on a call returning 200. [references/scaffold.md](references/scaffold.md)
- **Integrate.** 74 operations, with their hosts and headers. [references/integrate.md](references/integrate.md)
- **Debug.** The loop from a failed call to a named fix, and 422 recorded error codes. [references/debug.md](references/debug.md)
- **Test.** 0 test cases, each with the call it makes and what to see when it passes. [references/test.md](references/test.md)

Open one when the work calls for it. This file is the map, not the material.

## Before anything else

- Nothing here has been run against the ABDM sandbox. Treat request and response shapes as unconfirmed, and check a response before you rely on its shape.
- P1 is the patient side of M1. M1 is how a hospital system creates an ABHA; P1 is how the person's own application does it and maintains the account afterwards.
- Every user needs an ABHA address, `username@abdm`. Consent, notifications and record sharing all hang off it.
- Build both creation paths: by mobile number, and by an existing 14 digit ABHA number.
- All four login routes are mandatory.
- A user can hold several ABHA addresses but only one ABHA number.

## Practices that hold across every call

- Read the body, not only the status. A refusal often names the field in its body while the status says nothing useful, and a bad clock can arrive as a 404.
- When ABDM publishes a parameter, read it rather than hard coding what it currently says. The certificate endpoints return the encryption algorithm beside the key; code that reads that field survives a rotation and code that assumes a constant fails silently on the day it changes. Refuse to act on a published value you do not recognise rather than falling back to a default.
- Read every field in a response, not the one you came for. The M1 certificate call returns the padding next to the key, and a catalogue that recorded only the key cost an integrator a day rediscovering it.
- Prove an assumption against a call that is able to disagree with you. An endpoint that refuses every input with one message cannot tell you which input was right, and testing against it turns a correct answer into a ruled out one.
- Suspect the transport before the data. When a call refuses a value you believe in, check the encryption, the headers and the clock before you doubt the number. Those failures are reported as if the value were wrong.
- Do not carry an encryption path from one module to another. The padding, the certificate and the key size belong to the registry you are calling, and a path that works in one module produces a value another cannot read.
- Never log a sensitive value before you encrypt it, and never send one to a remote service to be encrypted. Both move the leak rather than removing it.
- Generate a fresh REQUEST-ID for every call and log it before sending. Once a call has failed it is the only handle on it.
- Do not match an error code with string equality. ABDM returns codes carrying trailing punctuation and whitespace, observed as `"code": "ABDM-9999: "`. Trim and compare on the prefix, or the branch you wrote for that code never runs.
- Send TIMESTAMP in UTC with milliseconds and a trailing Z. Local time is refused, sometimes as a 404.
- Cache a public certificate with a validity window rather than forever. A rotation fails every encrypted call at once, and a cache with no expiry cannot recover on its own.
