# Create ABHA by driving licence

Functionality 15 of 17 in M1's build order. Its group applies to every entity type. Read [run.md](../run.md) and [foundations.md](../foundations.md) once per session before this file.

## The loop

| Phase | In this file | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| Design | Screen requirements | Each screen requirement below is mapped to a screen in `INTEGRATION-PLAN.md`; Create ABHA by driving licence holds no mandatory case |
| Scaffold | Calls | Create ABHA by driving licence makes no ABDM call; skip to Integrate |
| Integrate | Integrate notes | Create ABHA by driving licence works end to end on your own screen, for the screens the notes name |
| Debug | Errors, then the loop in [errors.md](../errors.md) | The failing step of Create ABHA by driving licence succeeds |
| Test | Cases, How the cases run | Each of `CRT_ABHA_401`, `CRT_ABHA_402`, `CRT_ABHA_403`, `CRT_ABHA_404`, `CRT_ABHA_405`, `CRT_ABHA_406`, `CRT_ABHA_407`, `CRT_ABHA_408`, `CRT_ABHA_410`, `CRT_ABHA_411` is recorded in the workbook |
| Record | [run.md](../run.md): the workbook writer, the report | The draft report shows Create ABHA by driving licence |

Loop limit: 3 passes through Test for Create ABHA by driving licence. On the fourth, escalate in the format [run.md](../run.md) sets out, naming the case among `CRT_ABHA_401`, `CRT_ABHA_402`, `CRT_ABHA_403`, `CRT_ABHA_404`, `CRT_ABHA_405`, `CRT_ABHA_406`, `CRT_ABHA_407`, `CRT_ABHA_408`, `CRT_ABHA_410`, `CRT_ABHA_411`.
An integration that already exists enters Create ABHA by driving licence at Test, and goes back to Design or Integrate only for a case that fails.

## Screen requirements

### In plain words

The person creates an ABHA with a driving licence instead of Aadhaar, and an
operator checks the document. The enrolment by document call is not in the
published M1 specification, so these screens can be built and judged, and the
calls behind them cannot be made yet.

### What happens

| Requirement | Cases |
|---|---|
| Creation offers the driving licence as a method | CRT_ABHA_401 |
| The consent screen from create-abha-aadhaar-otp, where the declaration about a document other than Aadhaar is the one that leads here | CRT_ABHA_402 |
| Take the communication mobile and verify it by OTP | CRT_ABHA_403, CRT_ABHA_404 |
| Take the licence number with the name, date of birth and gender as the document shows them | CRT_ABHA_405 |
| Upload a photo of the front and of the back of the licence | CRT_ABHA_406 |
| An operator checks the documents and approves or rejects the creation | CRT_ABHA_407 |
| Show the 14 digit number as the ABHA number, never as a Health ID | CRT_ABHA_408 |
| Show the ABHA card, or print the ABHA number and address on your own card, saved and linked to your beneficiary id | CRT_ABHA_410, CRT_ABHA_411 |

### How you know it worked

Each screen above exists and holds what its case names.

From `hiecm.concept.m1-screens-create-abha-driving-licence`.

## Calls

Create ABHA by driving licence makes no ABDM call: no operation in the specification serves its cases.

- CRT_ABHA_404, step 1: Sends and verifies the mobile OTP. The spec has request/otp and auth/byAbdm only inside the Aadhaar, face and biometric creation journeys, not for a driving licence.
- CRT_ABHA_405, step 3: Verifies the licence and returns an enrolment number through enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks.
- CRT_ABHA_406, step 1: Uploads the front and back of the licence through enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks.
- CRT_ABHA_407, step 1: The operator's approval creates the ABHA through enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks.
- CRT_ABHA_408, step 1: Shows the ABHA number enrol/byDocument would return; the spec lacks that call.
- CRT_ABHA_410, step 1: Shows the ABHA card; profile/account/abha-card needs the token enrol/byDocument would return, and the spec lacks that call.
- CRT_ABHA_411, step 1: Prints the ABHA number and address enrol/byDocument would return; the spec lacks that call.

## Integrate notes

| Case | Screen | Calls |
|---|---|---|
| CRT_ABHA_401 | Create ABHA entry, method choice | None: Screen only. The option to start creation is checked before any call. |
| CRT_ABHA_402 | Driving licence consent | None: Screen only. Consent is shown and captured before any call. |
| CRT_ABHA_403 | Communication mobile entry | None: Screen only. The mobile is entered before any call. |
| CRT_ABHA_404 | Communication mobile OTP | None: The column names request/otp and auth/byAbdm, but the spec has them only inside the Aadhaar, face and biometric creation journeys, never for a driving licence, so no operation is mapped. |
| CRT_ABHA_405 | Driving licence details | None: The column names enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks. |
| CRT_ABHA_406 | Driving licence upload, front and back | None: The column names enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks. |
| CRT_ABHA_407 | Operator verification of the licence | None: The column names enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks. |
| CRT_ABHA_408 | Created ABHA number | None: The column names enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks. |
| CRT_ABHA_410 | ABHA card, view and download | None: The column names enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks; the card call needs the token that call would return. |
| CRT_ABHA_411 | Integrator's own card with ABHA details | None: The column names enrol/byDocument, which the spec lacks. |

## Errors

The specification's examples return no error code on the calls of Create ABHA by driving licence.

Other codes, and the debug loop: [errors.md](../errors.md).

| Case | Needs | Steps with no call |
|---|---|---|
| CRT_ABHA_401 | nothing | none |
| CRT_ABHA_402 | nothing | none |
| CRT_ABHA_403 | nothing | none |
| CRT_ABHA_404 | `otp` | step 1 |
| CRT_ABHA_405 | `driving-licence` | step 3 |

| CRT_ABHA_407 | `driving-licence` | step 1 |
| CRT_ABHA_408 | `driving-licence` | step 1 |
| CRT_ABHA_410 | `driving-licence` | step 1 |
| CRT_ABHA_411 | `driving-licence` | step 1 |

### CRT_ABHA_401 to 411: create an ABHA by driving licence

The set names `/abha/api/v3/enrollment/enrol/byDocument` for every case in this group. ABDM's M1 specification does not publish that operation, so there is no operation id to call. Record every case in this group `not-run` with that reason, until an operation is published. Do not improvise a call. Each heading names the evidence the case will need once an operation exists.

Loop limit: 3 passes per test case.

#### CRT_ABHA_401, the option exists. `screen`

The set checks that your system offers creation by driving licence.

#### CRT_ABHA_402, consent is shown and recorded. `screen`

The set checks consent for sharing the driving licence details, as CRT_ABHA_102.

#### CRT_ABHA_403, the communication mobile is collected. `screen`

#### CRT_ABHA_404, the mobile is verified by OTP. `sandbox`, `human`

#### CRT_ABHA_405, the driving licence is verified. `sandbox`

The set describes an enrolment number returned after the licence, name, date of birth and gender are checked, which the person takes to an ABDM facility.

#### CRT_ABHA_406, the licence front and back are uploaded. `screen`

#### CRT_ABHA_407, an operator checks the documents and approves or rejects. `human`

#### CRT_ABHA_408, the ABHA number is displayed. `screen`

#### CRT_ABHA_410, the ABHA card can be viewed. `sandbox` and `screen`

#### CRT_ABHA_411, your own card carries the ABHA details. `screen`
