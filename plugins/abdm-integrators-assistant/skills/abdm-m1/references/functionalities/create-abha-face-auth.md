## Screen requirements

### In plain words

Your screen shows a QR code. The person scans it with the ABHA app, logged
out, and captures their face in the ABHA Face RD app on their own phone. Your
screen waits for the result, then carries on to the communication mobile.

### What happens

| Requirement | Cases |
|---|---|
| Creation offers face authentication as a method for Aadhaar based creation | CRT_ABHA_101_FA |
| An invalid Aadhaar number is refused on the screen with "Aadhaar Number is not valid", and no QR code is generated | CRT_ABHA_102_FA |
| The consent screen from create-abha-aadhaar-otp, with its language choice, comes before the QR code. No QR code until consent is in | CRT_ABHA_103_FA, CRT_ABHA_104_FA |
| Show the QR code clearly on your screen, with the instruction to scan it with the scanner on the ABHA app's logged out landing page | CRT_ABHA_105_FA |
| Wait for the face authentication status, polling `capturePID`, and move to the communication mobile only on success | CRT_ABHA_108_FA |
| A failed face authentication stops the journey and shows the PID error code and message the API returned. The person can retry, or a new QR code is generated | CRT_ABHA_109_FA |
| The communication mobile is always verified by OTP in this route, whether or not it is the Aadhaar linked one. The OTP and resend rules are in create-abha-aadhaar-otp | CRT_ABHA_110_FA, CRT_ABHA_111_FA, CRT_ABHA_112_FA |
| The address step, the profile, the card and a returning patient follow create-abha-aadhaar-otp, and the profile and card show the communication mobile verified here | CRT_ABHA_113_FA, CRT_ABHA_114_FA, CRT_ABHA_115_FA, CRT_ABHA_116_FA, CRT_ABHA_117_FA |

### How you know it worked

The QR code appears only after consent and a valid Aadhaar, and the created
profile shows the mobile verified after face authentication.

### CRT_ABHA_101_FA to 117_FA: create an ABHA by Aadhaar face authentication

The set lists no API for this group. ABDM publishes the face authentication creation flow, so the operation ids below are the ones that observe it. `hiecm.flow.m1-create-abha-face-auth`

Face authentication is a `human` step on a device. The person scans a QR code from your screen with the ABHA app, logged out, and captures their face in the ABHA Face RD app on their phone. Ask for that phone and that person at readiness and again at each case. Without them, record every case from CRT_ABHA_106_FA on that you claim as `needs-human`, naming what was asked, after it was asked for at readiness and again at the case, and the tester said they cannot provide it in this run. A case you do not claim is `not-run`, because the whole group is optional.

Loop limit: 3 passes per test case.

**Preconditions.** A gateway access token less than 30 minutes old. A person present with their Aadhaar number and a phone with the ABHA app installed and logged out. Their Aadhaar number searched first on the login path and not found.

#### CRT_ABHA_101_FA, the face authentication option exists. `screen`

Your ABHA creation screen offers face authentication as a way to authenticate the Aadhaar number. Evidence: the screen with the option.

#### CRT_ABHA_102_FA, an invalid Aadhaar number is refused before a QR code. `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_104, with blank input as well. No QR code is generated for an invalid number, so no `m1_post_v3_enrollment_enrol_auth_init_create_abha_face_au_4dea33` call is in the log for that attempt.

#### CRT_ABHA_103_FA, consent comes before the QR code. `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_102. Your system does not generate the face authentication QR code until consent is recorded. Evidence: the consent screen, the stored record, and no init call before it in the log. `hiecm.concept.m1-screen-contract`

#### CRT_ABHA_104_FA, consent in another language. `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_103.

#### CRT_ABHA_105_FA, the face authentication QR code is generated. `sandbox` and `screen`

After the Aadhaar number and consent, your system generates a transaction and shows it as a QR code.

Exit condition: `m1_post_v3_enrollment_enrol_auth_init_create_abha_face_au_4dea33` returns 200 with a `txnId`. Screen check: the QR code is shown clearly, and the person is told to scan it with the scanner on the logged out ABHA app's landing page.

#### CRT_ABHA_106_FA, the QR code is scanned in the ABHA app. `human`

The person opens the ABHA app logged out, taps the scanner at the top left of the landing page, and scans your QR code. The ABHA app starts face authentication and opens the ABHA Face RD app. No call of yours proves the scan. Evidence: the phone screen after the scan, and the `status` from `m1_post_v3_enrollment_enrol_capturepid_create_abha_face_a_417d5e` pasted at that moment.

#### CRT_ABHA_107_FA, the ABHA Face RD app is not installed. `human`

On a phone without the ABHA Face RD app, the scan sends the person to the Play Store or App Store to install it, and they can then continue or restart. This is the ABHA app's behaviour, not your system's. Evidence: the phone screen at the store. If you claim the case and no such phone is available, record `needs-human` naming what was asked, after it was asked for at readiness and again at the case, and the tester said they cannot provide it in this run.

#### CRT_ABHA_108_FA, face authentication succeeds. `sandbox`, `human`

The person captures their face. Poll the status every 5 to 10 seconds while they do.

Exit condition: `m1_post_v3_enrollment_enrol_capturepid_create_abha_face_a_417d5e` returns 200 with `status` `COMPLETE`. Screen check: the phone shows success, and your system moves on to the communication mobile step.

#### CRT_ABHA_109_FA, a failed face authentication is refused. `sandbox`, `human`

The person does a scan that fails: another face, a poor capture, or a timeout.

Exit condition: `m1_post_v3_enrollment_enrol_capturepid_create_abha_face_a_417d5e` returns 200 with `status` `FAILED` and a `message`. Your screen shows that message, does not go on to the mobile step or creation, and lets the person retry or generate a new QR code.

#### CRT_ABHA_110_FA, the communication mobile is collected after face authentication. `sandbox`, `human`

Your system asks for the communication mobile after face authentication, checks its format, and sends an OTP to it. The set asks for the OTP whether or not this is the Aadhaar linked mobile.

Exit condition: two literals, both pasted.

1. `m1_post_v3_enrollment_enrol_byaadhaar_face`, sent with the `txnId` from CRT_ABHA_108_FA and that mobile, returns 200 with `tokens.token` present and `ABHAProfile.ABHANumber` present.
2. `m1_post_v3_enrollment_request_otp_mobile_verify_create_ab_6474ce` returns 200 with a `txnId` and a `message` naming the masked mobile.

#### CRT_ABHA_111_FA, the communication mobile OTP is verified. `sandbox`, `human`

Two observations, both needed. The person enters both OTPs. Stop for each.

1. A wrong OTP: `m1_post_v3_enrollment_auth_byabdm_mobile_verify_create_ab_b555fb` returns 400 with `description` naming an invalid OTP value, and your screen shows that error.
2. The right OTP: the same call returns 200 with `authResult` `success`.

Screen check: the OTP field accepts only six digits.

#### CRT_ABHA_112_FA, resend the communication mobile OTP. `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_106, for the communication mobile OTP.

#### CRT_ABHA_113_FA, the ABHA address is suggested and validated. `sandbox` and `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_112, with the face flow's calls. Exit condition: `m1_get_v3_enrollment_enrol_suggestion_create_abha_face_au_848b26` returns 200 with `abhaAddressList` holding at least three entries, and `m1_post_v3_enrollment_enrol_abha_address_create_abha_face_4b1f33` returns 200 with `preferredAbhaAddress` equal to the one chosen.

#### CRT_ABHA_114_FA, the ABHA number is displayed. `sandbox` and `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_113. Exit condition: `m1_get_v3_profile_account`, sent with the `X-token` from CRT_ABHA_110_FA, returns 200 with the same `ABHANumber` and a masked `mobile` ending in the digits of the mobile verified in CRT_ABHA_111_FA.

#### CRT_ABHA_115_FA, the ABHA card can be viewed and downloaded. `sandbox` and `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_114.

#### CRT_ABHA_116_FA, your own card carries the ABHA details. `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_115.

#### CRT_ABHA_117_FA, a returning patient is matched, not registered again. `screen`

As CRT_ABHA_116, for a person created by face authentication.
