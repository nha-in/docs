- 3\. OTP should not be submitted before the patient selects the required ABHA profile.

### VRFY_ABHA_303: No ABHA Profile Linked with Communication Mobile Number

The system must handle the scenario where no ABHA profile is linked with the entered communication mobile number.

**Steps**

- 1\. Enter a valid communication mobile number that is not linked with any ABHA profile.
- 2\. Click on Search / Proceed.

**Expected Result**

- 1\. The system should display: "ABHA details not found. We did not find any ABHA number linked to this mobile number. Please use an ABHA-linked mobile number."
- 2\. The system should provide an option to create a new ABHA, if supported as per business flow.
- 3\. No OTP verification screen should be opened for retrieval.

### VRFY_ABHA_304: Select Required ABHA Profile and Trigger OTP

The system must allow the patient to select the required ABHA profile from the list and then trigger OTP to the communication mobile number.

**Steps**

- 1\. From the displayed ABHA profile list, select the required ABHA profile.
- 2\. Click on Send OTP / Proceed.
- 3\. Wait for OTP on the communication mobile number.

**Expected Result**

- 1\. OTP should be triggered only after profile selection.
- 2\. OTP should be sent to the communication mobile number linked with the selected ABHA profile.
- 3\. The system should open the OTP verification screen.
- 4\. The selected profile context should be retained until OTP verification is completed.

**For the tester**

- 1\. If user tries to resend more than 2 times, system should display an appropriate, “Maximum OTP resend attempts reached. Please try again after 30 mins".

### VRFY_ABHA_305: Verify OTP and Open Selected ABHA Profile

The system must verify OTP and display the selected ABHA profile details after successful OTP authentication.

**Steps**

- 1\. Enter the valid OTP received on the communication mobile number.
- 2\. Submit OTP for verification.

**Expected Result**

- 1\. OTP should be verified successfully.
- 2\. The selected patient ABHA profile should open.
- 3\. The system should fetch and display profile details such as name, date of birth / age, gender, mobile number, ABHA number, ABHA address, state, district, photo and address, as available from APIs.
- 4\. The system should not display details of any non-selected ABHA profile.

### VRFY_ABHA_306: Auto-populate ABHA Profile Details in HMIS Registration Form

After successful OTP verification, the system must auto-populate the selected ABHA profile details in HMIS for registration or linking.

**Steps**

- 1\. Complete OTP verification successfully.
- 2\. Navigate to registration / linking screen.
- 3\. Verify the fields populated in HMIS.

**Expected Result**

- 1\. ABHA profile details should be auto-populated in the HMIS registration form.

- 2\. Duplicate beneficiary registration should not be created.
- 3\. Existing beneficiary linkage should be shown or handled as per organization business rules.

## Screen requirements

### In plain words

One mobile can hold several ABHAs. The search lists them for free, before
any OTP, so the person picks theirs first and the OTP goes to that one.

### What happens

| Requirement | Cases |
|---|---|
| The mobile field takes ten digits and nothing else. Anything else shows "Please enter a valid mobile number." and no search is sent | VRFY_ABHA_301 |
| Search first and list every ABHA on the mobile, each with enough to tell them apart: the masked ABHA number, the ABHA address and the name, as the search returns them | VRFY_ABHA_302 |
| No OTP is sent before a profile is chosen. Send OTP appears only after the choice, and the OTP request carries the chosen profile's `index` and the search's `txnId` | VRFY_ABHA_302, VRFY_ABHA_304 |
| The chosen profile stays chosen until the OTP verifies | VRFY_ABHA_304 |
| A mobile with no ABHA shows "ABHA details not found. We did not find any ABHA number linked to this mobile number. Please use an ABHA-linked mobile number.", offers to create an ABHA, and opens no OTP screen | VRFY_ABHA_303 |
| After the OTP verifies, open the chosen profile only, never another ABHA on the same mobile | VRFY_ABHA_305 |
| The profile fills the registration form under the read only rule in login-abha-number, and the ABHA number and address are linked to your beneficiary id | VRFY_ABHA_306 |
| A wrong OTP opens nothing and shows ABDM's message, under the OTP rules in create-abha-aadhaar-otp | VRFY_ABHA_307 |
| When the chosen ABHA is already linked in your records, show "This ABHA profile is already linked to HMIS Beneficiary ID." and a comparison screen: the details from the ABHA beside the details your record holds. No second registration is created | VRFY_ABHA_308 |

### How you know it worked

The list appears before any OTP, the OTP reaches only the chosen profile, and
running the same person twice opens the comparison screen the second time.

### When it goes wrong

- An OTP sent on the mobile before the list fails VRFY_ABHA_302 and 304.
- A second patient row for an already linked ABHA fails VRFY_ABHA_308.

### VRFY_ABHA_301 to 308: find an ABHA by the communication mobile and OTP

This is the lookup that costs no Aadhaar OTP, so it is the one your desk should run first.

Calls, in order: `m1_post_v3_profile_account_abha_search_find_abha_mobile_otp`, `m1_post_v3_profile_login_request_otp_find_abha_mobile` with the chosen account's `index` and the search `txnId`, the OTP, `m1_post_v3_profile_login_verify_find_abha_mobile`, then `m1_get_v3_profile_account` with the returned `token` as `X-token`. `hiecm.flow.m1-find-abha`

Loop limit: 3 passes per test case.

#### VRFY_ABHA_301, an invalid mobile is refused. `screen`

Fewer than ten digits, more than ten, letters, special characters and blank input are each refused on screen with "Please enter a valid mobile number.", and no search is sent.

#### VRFY_ABHA_302, every ABHA on this mobile is listed. `sandbox` and `screen`

Exit condition: the search returns 200 with a top level array. `[0].txnId` is present, and `[0].ABHA[]` holds the accounts, each entry carrying `index`, `ABHANumber` and `name`. Paste it.

The specification also carries a saved example without the `ABHA` array, an object with `txnId` and `message`, marked for confirmation with NHA. A run that sees that shape pastes it and records the difference in the run log.

Screen checks: every account in the array is listed, with enough to tell them apart, such as the masked ABHA number and the name. No OTP is requested before the person picks one.

Nudge: read the array as plural. One mobile can hold up to six accounts, and a screen that shows the first one silently links the wrong person.

#### VRFY_ABHA_303, no ABHA on this mobile. `sandbox`

Exit condition: the search returns 404 with `error.code` `ABDM-1114`. Your screen says "ABHA details not found. We did not find any ABHA number linked to this mobile number. Please use an ABHA-linked mobile number.", and opens no OTP screen. If your business flow supports creation, the screen also offers to create a new ABHA. `hiecm.concept.m1-journey-completes-without-abha`

#### VRFY_ABHA_304, the chosen ABHA gets the OTP. `sandbox`, `human`

Exit condition: `m1_post_v3_profile_login_request_otp_find_abha_mobile` returns 200 with a `txnId` and a `message` naming the masked mobile, sent only after the person picked an account. Screen checks: the OTP screen opens, the chosen account stays selected until verification, and resend works as in CRT_ABHA_106.

#### VRFY_ABHA_305, the OTP is verified and the chosen ABHA opens. `sandbox`, `human`

Exit condition: `m1_post_v3_profile_login_verify_find_abha_mobile` returns 200 with `authResult` `success`, `token`, and `accounts` holding the chosen `ABHANumber`; the profile call returns 200 with that `ABHANumber`. Screen check: only the chosen profile is shown, with name, date of birth or age, gender, mobile, ABHA number, ABHA address, state, district, photo and address as the API returned them.

#### VRFY_ABHA_306, the registration form is filled from the profile. `screen`

After VRFY_ABHA_305, your registration or linking form is filled from the profile. Name, date of birth or age and gender are not editable. Address, email, mobile, state, district and city are editable. After registration, the ABHA number and ABHA address are linked to your beneficiary id. Evidence: the form, and the stored link. `hiecm.concept.m1-confirm-the-filled-form`

#### VRFY_ABHA_307, a wrong OTP is refused. `sandbox`, `human`

Exit condition: `m1_post_v3_profile_login_verify_find_abha_mobile` returns 400 with `otpValue` naming an invalid OTP value. Your screen shows an error such as "Invalid OTP. Please enter a valid OTP.", opens no profile, and allows a retry without re-entering the mobile.

#### VRFY_ABHA_308, the chosen ABHA is already linked in your system. `screen`

Pick an account already linked to one of your patients. After VRFY_ABHA_305 your screen says "This ABHA profile is already linked to HMIS Beneficiary ID.", shows the ABHA details and your stored details side by side, and creates no second registration. Evidence: the screen and one row in your database. `hiecm.concept.m1-avoiding-duplicate-abha`
