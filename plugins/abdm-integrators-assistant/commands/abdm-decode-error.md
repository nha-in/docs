description: Turn an ABDM response into the code, the cause and the named fix.
argument-hint: '<pasted response body, or an ABDM-nnnn code>'
---

Decode `$ARGUMENTS` into the error it names and the fix that clears it.

## Read the shape before the code

ABDM returns four error shapes and a parser written for one will miss three.

| Shape | Where the code is |
|---|---|
| `{"error": {"code": "ABDM-1204", ...}}` | `error.code`, from the service's business logic |
| `{"code": "ABDM-1094", "timestamp": ...}` | top level `code`, same family, no wrapper |
| `{"txnId": "Invalid Transaction Id", ...}` | no code. Every key but `timestamp` names a field you got wrong |
| `{"code": "900901", "description": ...}` | the API gateway in front of the service, before your request reached it |

Read `error.code` first and fall back to a top level `code`. A numeric code with a `description` field is an authorisation problem, not a business one.

## Then match it

Load the module's skill. Each module skill's `references/debug.md` lists the codes its specification's examples return, with message, status and operation. The module skills are `abdm-gateway`, `abdm-m1` through `abdm-m4`, `abdm-p1` through `abdm-p4` and `abdm-scan-and-pay`.

## What a field validation body does not tell you

A body naming a field is reporting the field, not the cause. When the field carried an encrypted value, the encryption is the first thing to check and the value is the last. A call that returns the same body for every input tells you nothing about which input was right.

## Output

1. The shape, and where the code was found
2. The code, its message, and the operation that returns it
3. The named fix
4. The exit condition: the original call succeeding, not the fix being applied

Where no listed code matches, say so and name the two most likely causes rather than picking one. Do not invent a code.
