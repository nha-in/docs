# Patient app: acknowledge a notification subscription

`POST /v1/notification/on_subscribe`

BSP-side subscription acknowledgement; the same name denotes the callback where NHCX pushes claim-event notifications for a subscribed ABHA ID.

### Business purpose

Two things share this name. The API reference defines an NHCX-side operation (operationId onSubscribe) that takes a NotificationOnSubscribePayload with the beneficiary's abhaid, optional domain_values and plain header values, and returns a SubscribeResponse; it is described as the BSP-side subscription persistence acknowledgement. The integration guide uses the same path on the BSP's own host as the callback where NHCX delivers notifications. Together they complete the beneficiary-facing loop: the patient's app learns, in plain language, that a preauth was approved, a claim adjudicated, a payment made or information requested. The caller is a Beneficiary Service Provider; the persona label is the nearest available.

### When to use

A beneficiary app hosts this path to receive notifications for the ABHA IDs it subscribed. NHCX calls it when a pre-authorisation, claim, payment or query event happens.

### Preconditions

- An active subscription exists for the ABHA ID, made through `/v1/notification/subscribe`.
- Your callback runs over HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher, at the registered `on_notification_URL`.
- You check the token NHCX sends and its sender code.

### Postconditions

Each notification carries a `message` you can show the user as it is. Nothing changes in the exchange between hospital and payer.

### Common mistakes

- Building the user message from `domain_values`, which may be missing, instead of showing `message`.
- Reading the status from `x-hcx-workflow_ID`. It lives in `x-hcx-status`.
- Assuming the subscription is still yours after it shows `replaced`.
- Accepting calls without checking the token or the sender code.

### Best practices

- Display message verbatim; keep domain_values for audit logging or advanced formatting only.
- Validate the JWT and sender_code on every inbound push, enforce TLS 1.2 or higher and rate limiting.
- Map event types (preauth_response, claim_response, payment_notice, communication) to in-app timelines using x-hcx-action and x-hcx-status.
- Show subscription status in settings so a replaced subscription is visible to the user; resubscribe on next login.
- Keep the endpoint fast and idempotent on notification_ID.

### Related scenario

A PHR app has subscribed ravi@ABDM to workflow_events. A hospital submits a claim on /v1/claim/submit for that beneficiary and the payer adjudicates it on /v1/claim/on_submit. NHCX forks the outcome to the app's registered on_subscribe callback with topic_code workflow_events, a message stating the claim was approved with the amount, and domain_values including x-hcx-action claim_response and x-hcx-status response.complete. The app validates the JWT and sender_code, shows the message on the patient's timeline, and when the payer later sends a payment notice on /v1/paymentnotice/request the next push reads paid.

## Authorization

- `bearer_auth` (apiKey, required): Every NHCX call carries the access token from the session call in a header named `bearer_auth`, as the word `Bearer`, a space and the token. NHCX reads `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`.

## Body

- `request` (object)
- `request.abhaid` (string)
- `request.domain_values` (object)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-workflow_id` (string)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-correlation_id` (string)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-timestamp` (string)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-sender_code` (string)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-recipient_code` (string)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-status` (string)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-action` (string)
- `request.domain_values.x-hcx-amount_submitted` (string)
- `hvalues` (object)
- `hvalues.senderid` (string)
- `hvalues.receiverid` (string)
- `hvalues.correlationid` (string)
- `hvalues.status` (string)
- `hvalues.workflowid` (string)

## Responses

- `200`: The NHCX-side operation returns HTTP 200 with a SubscribeResponse (timestamp, api_call_id, correlation_id, subscription_id, subscription_status active, replaced or expired, expiry, message); 400, 401, 403, 409 and 500 return a StatusSuccessResponse with the same descriptions as the subscribe table.
  - `timestamp` (string)
  - `api_call_id` (string)
  - `correlation_id` (string)
  - `subscription_id` (string)
  - `subscription_status` (string)
  - `expiry` (string)
  - `message` (string)
