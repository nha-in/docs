# D18. claim_preauth

#### D18T. TABLE
One row is the pre-authorisation leg of one claim: the last send (first request, query answer, enhancement), the payer's verdict on it and any cancellation. Primary key `id`. Parent table: `claim` (D9), one row per claim.

#### D18D. DESCRIPTION
The draft itself lives on `claim` (D9) and its child tables (D16, D25, D26, D27, D28, D17). This row is the exchange. There is only ever one per claim: every later send, and the cancellation, overwrites it.

**Created.** The first "Send" on Pre-authorisation (S9), allowed only when the claim's eligibility status is `eligible`. The row is inserted with `status` `submitting`. If [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md) reports the send failed after naming the ids it went out under, the row is still written under those ids, marked as a refusal (below), and the error is shown.

**What each send writes.** `status` `submitting`, `txn_id` and `correlation_id` from the [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md) result, `submitted_at` now, `claim_ref` the claim number the bundle went under, `requested_amount` the sum of the lines (D16), `submission_kind`, `workflow_id`, `reply_text`, `request_json`; it clears `settled_at`, `error_message`, `preauth_ref`, `outcome`, `disposition`, `approved_amount`, `eligible_amount`, `submitted_amount`, `items_json` and `response_json`. An enhancement or a query answer then puts the earlier `preauth_ref` back, and keeps `enhancement_no` (an `enhancement` adds 1 to it).

**Which send it is** (`submission_kind`, chosen from the current row):

| Current row | Next send | Workflow id (PMJAY adapter, see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) |
|---|---|---|
| none, `cancelled` or `error` | `preauth` | 12 |
| `rejected` | `preauth` (a fresh pre-authorisation) [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | 12 |
| `queried`, last send an enhancement | `enhancement_resubmit` | 131 |
| `queried`, otherwise | `preauth_query_response` | 19 |
| `approved` / `partial` with lines added since | `enhancement` | 13 |
| `approved` / `partial`, nothing added | refused: "The pre-authorisation is already decided; add a line to ask for an enhancement." | |
| `submitting` / `cancelling` | refused: "The pre-authorisation is with the payer; wait for its answer before sending again." | |

A query answer and an enhancement query answer require the desk's reply text; it is stored in `reply_text` and carried as the `CQD` note [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Statuses** (exact strings): `submitting`, `approved`, `partial`, `queried`, `rejected`, `cancelling`, `cancelled`, `error`.

**The payer's reply** (C5, or the poll through A10 to A12 when the case is opened) is read from the ClaimResponse's `outcome` and claim-level `adjudication` reason together [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers):

| outcome / reason | status |
|---|---|
| outcome `queued` or `acknowledged`, or reason `submitted` or `acknowledged` | `submitting` (not a decision; `settled_at` stays null) |
| reason `cancelled`, `rejected` or `denied` | `rejected` (the `rejected` and `denied` reasons are a correction: the reference implementation read them as `queried`) |
| reason `queried` | `queried` |
| outcome `error` | `rejected` |
| outcome `partial`, reason `approved` | `partial` |
| outcome `partial`, any other reason | `queried` |
| outcome `complete`, reason `approved` or none | `approved` |
| anything else | `queried` |

Applying a reply writes `outcome`, `adjudication`, `disposition`, `preauth_ref` (kept when the reply carries none), the three totals, `items_json`, `query_note`, `api_call_id`, `settled_at` (when it is a decision), `response_json`, clears `error_message`, and copies the current `correlation_id` into `thread_correlation_id`. A reply is applied several times on one thread (acknowledgement, query, decision); one whose `x-hcx-api_call_id` equals `api_call_id` is a redelivery and is ignored. Without an api_call_id, a reply with the same `outcome` and `adjudication` as the row is treated as the same message.

**Refusals.** A ProtocolResponse on the thread, a peer or protocol error found by polling, or a send failure sets `status` `error` with the message, except that a refused `enhancement` or `enhancement_resubmit` goes back to `approved` with the message kept in `error_message` (the approved pre-authorisation stands). Either way `correlation_id` is put back to `thread_correlation_id` when there is one. A ledger that no longer has the transaction (404), or a failed dispatch, sets `error`.

**Revival.** A row on record as a failed send (`error`, or `approved` / `partial` / `queried` with an error message other than a refused cancellation) goes back to `submitting` when the payer answers on its thread, and the answer is then applied.

**Cancellation.** Allowed from `submitting`, `approved`, `partial` or `queried`. It writes `pre_cancel_status` (the status it had), `status` `cancelling`, `cancel_txn_id`, `cancel_correlation_id`, `cancel_requested_at`, `cancel_reason` (a key: `treatmentplanchanged`, `patientrequest`, `financialconstraints`, `alternativetreatment`, `duplicateclaim`, `administrativeerror`, `other`; `other` requires a note), `cancel_note`, and clears `error_message` (`error` when the send failed). The payer's Task reply (C7, or polling) then:

- accepted (Task status none, `completed` or `accepted`, and outcome not `error`): `status` `cancelled`, `settled_at`, `outcome`, `disposition`, `response_json`, and the claim is given a fresh claim number from the counter (D30). The withdrawn number stays here in `claim_ref`.
- refused: `status` back to `pre_cancel_status` (`approved` when none was recorded) with `error_message` "The payer did not accept the cancellation.". The reference implementation always set `approved`, even for a cancel sent from `submitting` or `queried`; restoring the earlier status is a correction. For 15 minutes after that, polling still looks for an acceptance on the thread [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

A ClaimResponse adjudicated `cancelled` on the pre-authorisation thread while `cancelling` also sets `cancelled`. Once `cancelled`, every further reply on the thread is ignored.

**Deleted.** Never by the application; by cascade with the claim or when the transactional store is cleared.

Every change goes through a write that also recomputes the claim's `stage` and `sub_stage` (D9).

#### D18K. KEYS AND INDEXES
- Primary key `id` (integer).
- Foreign key `claim_id` references `claim (id)` (D9), `ON DELETE CASCADE`; `claim_id` is UNIQUE (one leg per claim).
- Index `ix_claim_preauth_corr` on `(correlation_id)`. Inbound messages are also matched on `cancel_correlation_id` (no index) and, for payer-initiated messages, on `claim_ref`.
