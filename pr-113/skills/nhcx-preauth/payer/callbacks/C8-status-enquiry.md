# C8. Status Enquiry

#### C8E. ENDPOINT
Delivered in-process by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) for NHCX route `v1/status` (the HCX shape: no bundle, the thread named in the `x-hcx-status_filters` header) or `v1/task/submit` (the NHCX shape: a `Task` coded `status` naming the claim, which is where the NHCX sandbox makes hospitals send it, refusing `v1/status` with NHCX-1012 [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)). Classified `status` by C1 either way ([F10. Task (claim actions and answers)](../fhir/F10-task-claim-actions.md); a Task coded `status` whose output is `paymentack` is C11. Payment Acknowledgement (in nhcx-payment/payer) instead). Answered inside the same delivery by [A8. Status Answer](../apis/A8-status-answer.md), on the route that pairs with the one the ask came in on: `v1/on_status` for an ask on `v1/status`, `v1/task/on_submit` for a status Task, on the request's own correlation id. NHCX closes a thread with the callback that pairs with the route that opened it, so the other one would be refused.

#### C8D. DESCRIPTION
A hospital that has heard nothing asks where its submission stands. The answer is where the case is: as an `x-hcx-status_response` header, which is what the protocol reads, and as a Task bundle saying the same, which is what a FHIR reader expects.

**Which case.** The keys tried, in order, each against the pre-auth thread, the claim thread and the query thread of [D19. case](../database/D19-case.md) (`nhcx_correlation_id`, `nhcx_claim_correlation_id`, `nhcx_query_correlation_id`): the correlation id the enquiry names (`x-hcx-status_filters.correlation_id` or a Task input typed `correlationId`), the workflow id it names (`x-hcx-status_filters.workflow_id`), then the enquiry's own `x-hcx-workflow_id` (a hospital sends the leg's correlation id there [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)). Then the claim number (`x-hcx-status_filters.claim_number`, or the Task's `CLN` identifier or `claimNumber` input) as `case_for_claim_ref` for this sender.

**The answer.** With a case: `entity_type` (`preauth` at stage `preauth`; `claim` at `claim`, `payment` or `settled`; else `claim` when a claim leg is filed, `preauth` otherwise), `entity_status` (the claim status of the case, [F10. Task (claim actions and answers)](../fhir/F10-task-claim-actions.md)), the claim number, stage, outcome (the adjudication status), the three totals and whether the thread has been answered, plus a line a person reads: "Pre-authorisation <status>: <remarks>", "Claim <status>", "Approved for <amount>; <paid> paid so far", "Settled: <paid> paid", "Rejected", "Withdrawn". Without one: the Task `rejected`, status `not-found`, "No submission on that thread is on record with this payer." A thread this payer does not hold is still answered, because "not found" is where it stands.

**Nothing changes** on the case. Two [D27. case_exchange_message](../database/D27-case-exchange-message.md) rows are written when a case matched: the enquiry (the bundle, or the filters when it had none) and the answer (the header and the bundle).

#### C8Q. REQUEST
Either no `fhir` and `x-hcx-status_filters` in `jwe_headers` (an object, or a JSON string of one) carrying `x-hcx-correlation_id` or `correlation_id`, `x-hcx-workflow_id` or `workflow_id`, and `claim_number`, `claimNumber` or `x-hcx-claim_number`; or an [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) Bundle carrying [F10. Task (claim actions and answers)](../fhir/F10-task-claim-actions.md) Task coded `status` with an identifier typed `CLN` or inputs typed `claimNumber` and `correlationId`. Headers read: `x-hcx-sender_code`, `x-hcx-recipient_code`, `x-hcx-correlation_id` (the enquiry's own thread), `x-hcx-workflow_id`, `x-hcx-status_filters`.

```

#### C8S. RESPONSE
`settled` whether a case was found or not; `rejected` when the gateway refuses the answer; `error` when the gateway is not configured or unreachable, so NHCX redelivers.

State changes: none on the case. Two [D27. case_exchange_message](../database/D27-case-exchange-message.md) rows (in and out) when a case matched; one [D31. audit_log](../database/D31-audit-log.md) audit row (`status.answered`). In the sandbox an answered enquiry ticks the checklist [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
