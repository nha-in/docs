# C6. Claim Reply

#### C6E. ENDPOINT
Delivered in-process by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) for NHCX route `v1/claim/on_submit`, passed to `C1.receive` with `delivery.type` `claim`. Answers A5 (a claim, a query answer, a resubmission).

#### C6D. DESCRIPTION
The payer's verdict on the claim, read exactly as a pre-authorisation reply (C5): the same ClaimResponse reading, the same verdict mapping, several replies per thread (PMJAY acknowledges under workflow `25`, decides under `26` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)).

**Matching.** By `x-hcx-correlation_id` against the claim leg (D20 `correlation_id`, newest row). Nothing matching: `unmatched`.

**Redelivery.** The same `x-hcx-api_call_id` as the last applied reply is `ignored`; without one, a reply with the same outcome and adjudication as the leg holds, on a leg not `submitting`. After a reprocess (C8) the leg waits again on the same thread, and a verdict carrying a new api_call_id is applied. The `redelivery` flag G8 takes from [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md) is not used for this: the leg's own `api_call_id` decides.

Unlike C5 there is no status gate: any reply not already applied is applied, whatever the leg's status. A leg on record as a failed send (C1 `failed_send`) is reopened as `submitting` first.

#### C6Q. REQUEST
`fhir` is an F1 Bundle carrying the payer's F9 ClaimResponse (`use: claim`), usually beside F15 Patient, F17 Organizations and F18 Coverage.

Refusals arrive as a `ProtocolResponse` (for example PAYR-1322 [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)).

#### C6P. PSEUDOCODE

```
C6(envelope, corr):
    row = newest D20 where correlation_id == corr
    if none: return "unmatched"
    body = payload(envelope)
    if body.type == "ProtocolResponse":
        leg_write(D20, row, claim_door_refusal(row, rejection(body)))
        return "settled"
    parsed = read_claim_response(body)                  # C5; rejected when no ClaimResponse
    api_call_id = x-hcx-api_call_id or ""
    if already_applied(row, api_call_id, parsed): return "ignored"
    revive(D20, row, "submitting")
    status = verdict_status(parsed)                     # C5
    leg_write(D20, row, parsed + {status,
        api_call_id: api_call_id or null,
        settled_at: null if status == "submitting" else now,
        error_message: null, response_json: body,
        thread_correlation_id: row.correlation_id})
    return "settled"

claim_door_refusal(row, message):
    values = {status: "error", error_message: message}
    if row.submission_kind == "claim_query_response":
        values.status = "queried"                        # the query still stands
        values.disposition = row.disposition or row.query_note
    if row.thread_correlation_id: values.correlation_id = row.thread_correlation_id
    return values
```

#### C6S. RESPONSE
`settled`, `unmatched`, `ignored` for a redelivery, or `rejected` when the bundle carries no ClaimResponse.

State changes, D20 claim_submission (each write restamps D9 `stage` / `sub_stage`):

| Reply | `status` | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| acknowledgement | `submitting` | `outcome`, `adjudication`, `disposition`, `preauth_ref`, `approved_amount`, `eligible_amount`, `submitted_amount`, `items_json`, `query_note`, `api_call_id`, `settled_at` null, `response_json`, `thread_correlation_id` |
| decision | `approved`, `partial`, `queried` or `rejected` | as above, `settled_at` now |
| `ProtocolResponse` | `error`, or `queried` for a query answer (question restored in `disposition`) | `error_message` `<code>: <message>`; `correlation_id` back to `thread_correlation_id` when one is held |

A reply without `preAuthRef` writes `preauth_ref` empty here (only C5 keeps the stored one).
