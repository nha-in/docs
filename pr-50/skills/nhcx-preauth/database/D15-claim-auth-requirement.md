# D15. claim_auth_requirement

#### D15T. TABLE
One row is one document or form the payer's ruling says the procedure set must be accompanied by; primary key `id`; parent table [D13. claim_auth](D13-claim-auth.md).

#### D15D. DESCRIPTION
Read from each `authorizationSupporting` entry of every item in the payer's `auth-requirements` reply. The payer packs the deciding facts into the entry's free-text `text`, and the payer adapter reads them [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers):
- `fullUrl: <url>` present: `kind = 'form'`, and `form_url` is the url.
- Otherwise `kind = 'document'`.
- `Type: <word>` gives `stage`, lower-cased. With no Type, a document gets `pre` and a form gets an empty string.
- `Procedure Code: <code>` gives `for_code`. Otherwise it is the code of the item the entry sits under.
- `code` / `display` come from the entry's first coding.
- `at_preauth` is `1` for every form, and for a document whose `stage` is one of the adapter's pre-auth stages (`pre` for every adapter). Otherwise it is `0`.

Entries are de-duplicated on (`kind`, `code`, `form_url`) across the whole reply.

How it is used, when the ruling is `ready`:
- Pre-authorisation (S9): the documents with `at_preauth = 1` are required, and the forms with `at_preauth = 1` are looked up in [D12](D12-claim-plan-form.md) by `form_url`.
- Claim (S11): the documents with `at_preauth = 0` are required. Forms with `at_preauth = 0` would be asked for too, but every form is written with `at_preauth = 1`, so the claim leg in practice carries the policy-wide forms from the plan.
- Requirements are listed ordered by `kind, seq`.

Lifecycle:
- Inserted when a ruling is applied, numbered `seq` 1, 2, ..., after the ruling's earlier requirements are deleted in the same transaction.
- Deleted when a new check is requested for the claim, and with the ruling (`ON DELETE CASCADE`).
- Never updated in place.

#### D15C. COLUMNS
| column | type | null/default | meaning (and allowed values) |
|---|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER | primary key | row id |
| auth_id | INTEGER | NOT NULL | the ruling ([D13](D13-claim-auth.md)) |
| seq | INTEGER | NOT NULL, default `1` | order in the reply after de-duplication |
| kind | TEXT | NOT NULL | `document` or `form` |
| code | TEXT | null | document type code from the entry's coding |
| display | TEXT | null | its display |
| form_url | TEXT | null | Questionnaire url when `kind = 'form'`; null for a document |
| stage | TEXT | null | the payer's own word for when it is wanted (lower case, for example `pre`); empty for a form with no Type |
| for_code | TEXT | null | the line code it was asked for |
| at_preauth | INTEGER | NOT NULL, default `1` | `1` due with the pre-authorisation, `0` due with the claim |

#### D15K. KEYS AND INDEXES
- Primary key `id` (integer).
- `auth_id` references [D13. claim_auth](D13-claim-auth.md) `id`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- No unique constraint (de-duplication is done by the parser).
- Index: `ix_claim_auth_req (auth_id, seq)`.
- `form_url` names a [D12. claim_plan_form](D12-claim-plan-form.md) `url`, and `for_code` a [D16. claim_line](D16-claim-line.md) `code` (no foreign keys). Uploaded files are matched to a document requirement by `code` in [D28. claim_document](D28-claim-document.md).
