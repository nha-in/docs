# D1. organization

#### D1T. TABLE
One row is the healthcare facility this installation represents; primary key `id`; no parent table.

#### D1D. DESCRIPTION
The facility row is the provider on every NHCX message. Its `participant_code` is the `x-hcx-sender_code` on every outbound send. Its `identifier_value` (the HFR / facility ID) is the `providerId` on the eligibility check, the InsurancePlan discovery Task and the pre-auth and claim bundles. `name` and `phone` fill the provider Organization.

Lifecycle:
- Created once, by seeding, when the table is empty. The seeded row has `is_default = 1`, `type_code = 'prov'` and no `participant_code`.
- The application reads "the facility" as the first row ordered by `is_default DESC, id`. No screen adds a second row.
- Updated from the facility settings screen: every column except `id` and `is_default` is overwritten on save. `name` and `identifier_value` are required. `identifier_type_code` defaults to `NHRR`, `identifier_system` to `https://facility.abdm.gov.in`, `type_code` to `prov`, `country` to `India`.
- Never deleted. It is a master table and survives the "clear transactional data" reset.

Guards that read it:
- The eligibility check refuses to send while `identifier_value` is blank ("Set the facility's HFR ID under Settings before raising claims.") or `participant_code` is blank ("Set the facility's NHCX participant code under Settings before raising claims."). The InsurancePlan request refuses the same way, ending "before fetching a package master." instead.
- The session token call (A16, served by [G3. Session Token](../gateway/G3-session-token.md)) and the payer adjudication calls (A15) use `participant_code` to name the participant.

Payers are not rows in this table. A claim carries its payer on [D9. claim](D9-claim.md) (`payer_id`, `payer_name`), and the payer's participant code is mapped to a payer adapter by the `payer_adapter` kind of D8. terminology (in nhcx-preauth).
