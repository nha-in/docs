# A7. Communication Reply

#### A7E. ENDPOINT
In-process: `gateway.send("v1/communication/on_request", envelope)`, [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md), which encrypts it and posts it to NHCX for the payer, on the thread the payer's CommunicationRequest arrived on: `POST {nhcx}/v1/communication/on_request`. No answer to it is awaited: NHCX's acceptance, returned by G7, settles it.

#### A7D. DESCRIPTION
The payer starts a communication by sending a CommunicationRequest on `communication/request` (arrives through callback C9, type `communication`), on a thread of its own. When it is recorded, it is filed on a claim leg as either a **query** or a **notification** (see C9 for how it is classified). This route carries the application's answer to both:

| Variant | For | When sent |
|---|---|---|
| Reply | a query | when the desk sends the reply form (S10) |
| Acknowledgement | a notification | automatically, the moment the notification is recorded; again by hand only after a failure |

Reply: [C9. Payer Communication](../callbacks/C9-communication-request.md) (how a request is classified as a query or a notification)

**Headers.** Both variants use the same four:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `x-hcx-sender_code` | The facility's participant code |
| `x-hcx-recipient_code` | The request's `x-hcx-sender_code`, else the case's processing id, else the claim's payer id, else the configured default payer code |
| `x-hcx-correlation_id` | The correlation id the request arrived on. This is how the payer ties the answer to the question |
| `x-hcx-workflow_id` | The request's own `x-hcx-workflow_id`, else the queried leg's correlation id, else the claim number (the fallbacks are [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) |

The workflow id does not come from the payer adapter. G7 completes the other headers ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)); when the correlation id is blank, G7 takes it from the newest inbound communication request from the recipient in the [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md).

**Checks.**

Reply, in order:
1. "Query not found." / "That query is not on this claim." (the route checks the claim)
2. "That message is not a question: a notification is acknowledged and a note is read, neither takes an answer."
3. New files chosen on the form are filed on the claim first, at the queried leg's stage; the document upload errors apply and one bad file refuses the whole reply before anything is sent.
4. "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings before answering a query."
5. "Write a reply or attach a document, an empty answer tells the payer nothing."
6. "One of the chosen documents is not on this claim."

Acknowledgement: "That message is not on this claim." (route), "Only a notification is acknowledged; a query is answered from the communication tab.", "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings first."

#### A7Q. REQUEST

The arguments passed to G7 Send:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jwe_headers` | object | The four headers above |
| `fhir` | Bundle | The reply bundle or the acknowledgement bundle |

**Reply bundle.** A new Task and a new Communication carrying the reply text and the chosen documents, the payer's CommunicationRequest echoed, then the case resources lifted from the queried leg's own sent bundle (A4 or A5), or built from the case when that leg never went out.

**Acknowledgement bundle.** The request bundle as the payer sent it, sent back with the payer's Task marked completed.

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md), [F10. Task (claim actions)](../fhir/F10-task-claim-actions.md), [F12. Communication](../fhir/F12-communication.md), [F11. CommunicationRequest](../fhir/F11-communicationrequest.md), [F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md), [F15. Patient](../fhir/F15-patient.md), [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md), [F16. Practitioner and PractitionerRole](../fhir/F16-practitioner.md), [F18. Coverage](../fhir/F18-coverage.md)

Envelope, a real reply (Sandbox Payer):

```json
{
  "jwe_headers": {"x-hcx-sender_code": "<facility code>",
                  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<payer code>",
                  "x-hcx-correlation_id": "50c822b5-6923-4765-8bb0-65615e019e00",
                  "x-hcx-workflow_id": "24"},
  "fhir": <F1 Bundle carrying F10 Task (deliver, completed), F12 Communication (reply text and one attachment coded RAD), F11 CommunicationRequest echoed, F8 Claim, F15 Patient, F17 provider and payer Organizations, F16 Practitioner, F18 Coverage>
}
```

#### A7S. RESPONSE

**Acknowledgement:** the G7 result, `{"ok": true, "gateway_status": 202, "txn_id", "correlation_id", "request_id", "headers", "response", ...}`. Its `txn_id` is kept as the reply's transaction id.

- Reply: the query becomes `answered`, with the reply and its ids. The case's stage is recomputed, so it is no longer `queried`.
- Acknowledgement: the notification becomes `acknowledged`, with the same reply ids.

**Failure.** Any G7 error, or a result NHCX did not accept (`ok` false), sets the row to `error` with the message (a reply also keeps its text and document ids for the next try), plus the reply ids when the failure named them. The error is shown on the screen. An automatic acknowledgement that fails is kept on the row and never raised, so the notification is still recorded and the callback still answers 2xx.

Data: [D23. claim_query](../database/D23-claim-query.md), [D28. claim_document](../database/D28-claim-document.md)

**What comes back from the payer.** Nothing is waited for on this route. After a reply the queried leg waits for the payer's next verdict on its own thread.

Reply: C5. Pre-auth Reply (in nhcx-preauth), C6. Claim Reply (in nhcx-claim) (the next verdict), [C9. Payer Communication](../callbacks/C9-communication-request.md) (a follow-up query or note)
