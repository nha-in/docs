# D30. payment

#### D30T. TABLE
One row is one disbursement against one approved case ([D19. case](D19-case.md)); primary key `id`. Several are allowed: a claim can be settled in instalments. The reference implementation names it `payer_payments` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

#### D30D. DESCRIPTION
The money. Finance raises a payment against a case whose claim is approved, completes it with the bank's UTR, or records that the bank returned it; each movement is what the payment notice (A6. Payment Notice (in nhcx-payment/payer), F13. PaymentNotice (in nhcx-payment/payer), F14. PaymentReconciliation (in nhcx-payment/payer)) tells the hospital, and the hospital's acknowledgement (C11. Payment Acknowledgement (in nhcx-payment/payer)) is stamped here. A hospital asking where the money is (C10. Payment Enquiry (in nhcx-payment/payer)) is answered from these rows (A7. Payment Enquiry Answer (in nhcx-payment/payer)).

**Numbering.** `id` is `PAY-<year>-<serial>` from the `payment` counter ([D32. id_sequence](D32-id-sequence.md)), four digits [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); it is the `PaymentNotice.identifier` and the reconciliation's line identifier.

**Raised** by A14. Disburse (in nhcx-payment/payer) (`POST payments`), only by a role that may disburse ([D2. staff](D2-staff.md)):
- The case must be `approved` ("the case is not approved"); the case row is locked and every payment on it that is not `failed` is summed, so two terminals cannot each raise the last instalment; the new amount over what is left is refused ("over-payment"). The amount must be positive.
- TDS is computed once here (`tds_amount` = amount times percent, rounded to paise; `net_payable` = amount minus TDS), so the three numbers on the advice note always add up; the check enforces the arithmetic.
- With a `utr_no` given, the payment is raised and completed in one transaction (the one-step disbursement); without one it waits as `initiated`. Either way A6. Payment Notice (in nhcx-payment/payer) sends the notice and records the transaction in `nhcx_notice_txn_id`.

**Completed** by A14. Disburse (in nhcx-payment/payer) (`POST payments/:id/complete` with the UTR): the payment must be `initiated` ("the payment is closed"); the UTR goes on the row, `completed_at` now, the case's `total_paid` up by the amount, and the case becomes `settled` when the approved amount has gone out in full. A6. Payment Notice (in nhcx-payment/payer) sends the notice again with the UTR. A UTR is one movement of money and is unique across the table ("That UTR has already been recorded against another payment").

**Failed** by A14. Disburse (in nhcx-payment/payer) (`POST payments/:id/fail` with a note): from `initiated` only; the money never left, the case's paid total is untouched, and the amount becomes available to disburse again.

**Acknowledged** by C11. Payment Acknowledgement (in nhcx-payment/payer): every completed, unacknowledged payment on the case is stamped `nhcx_acknowledged_at` when the hospital's `paymentack` Task arrives.

Statuses (`status`): `initiated`, `completed`, `failed`. A completed transfer has a UTR and a completion time; nothing else may (`ck_payments_completion`). A bank transfer carries an account and an IFSC, UPI a handle, a cheque neither (`ck_payments_beneficiary`).

Delete: never; a case with payments cannot be removed (`RESTRICT`).

#### D30K. KEYS AND INDEXES
- Primary key `id`. Unique `uq_payments_utr` on `utr_no`.
- Foreign keys: `case_id` references [D19. case](D19-case.md) `id` (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`); `initiated_by` references the account table (`ON DELETE SET NULL`).
- Checks: `ck_payments_mode`; `ck_payments_status`; `ck_payments_amount` (`> 0`); `ck_payments_tds` (percent 0 to 100, amount 0 to `payment_amount`); `ck_payments_net` (`net_payable = payment_amount - tds_amount`); `ck_payments_completion` (`completed` with UTR and time, else neither); `ck_payments_beneficiary` (account and IFSC for NEFT, RTGS, IMPS; UPI handle for UPI; nothing for Cheque).
- Indexes: `idx_payments_case` on `(case_id, initiated_at)`; `idx_payments_status` on `(status, initiated_at)`.
