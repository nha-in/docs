# C5. Claim Submit

#### C5E. ENDPOINT
Delivered in-process by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) for NHCX route `v1/claim/submit`, passed to `C1.receive`, classified `claim` because the bundle holds a `Claim` with `use` `claim` ([F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md)). Acknowledged inside the same delivery by [A4. Claim Answer](../apis/A4-claim-answer.md) (outcome `queued`, workflow 25, `response.partial`) on `v1/claim/on_submit`; the verdict follows when a person decides ([S3. Case Desk](../screens/S3-case-desk.md), [A13. Adjudicate](../apis/A13-adjudicate.md)), on the claim's own correlation id. A query answer sent as a fresh claim (workflow 161 or 151 [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) arrives here too.

#### C5D. DESCRIPTION
After discharge the hospital submits the same shape as its pre-authorisation with the final bill, the discharge block and the documents. The send carries `x-hcx-use_case` (`New`, or `Resubmit` for a query answer or a resubmission); this payer does not need it and must not refuse a send for carrying it. It is filed on the case the pre-authorisation opened, and nothing is decided until a person decides.

**Proof of presence at discharge.** As on the pre-authorisation (C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer)), the claim may carry a user token on its headers, and under PMJAY it must be a fresh one taken at discharge (process type Discharge): the admission's token does not serve the claim, and the scheme refuses a claim with neither it nor the Discharge Consent QuestionnaireResponse (PAYR-1363; PAYR-1366 for a lapsed token). This desk records what it found and files the claim regardless [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Which case.** The pre-authorisation reference the claim quotes first (`Claim.related` prior, `insurance[].preAuthRef`, or an identifier typed `PAR`), then the hospital's own claim number, which most hospitals keep the same across the two legs; each is looked up as `case_for_claim_ref` (this payer's `claim_no` or case id, or the number the hospital gave the pre-auth or the claim, filed by this sender, an open case before a closed one). Only an open case (stage `preauth` or `claim`) can take a claim: a bill against a rejected, withdrawn, paid or settled case is refused, not silently reopened: "The pre-authorisation <claim_no> is <stage> and cannot take a claim" (`rejected`).

**A claim with no pre-authorisation behind it opens a case of its own**, at the claim stage, with its discharge already recorded. That is a legitimate thing for a hospital to do (an emergency admission, a reimbursement) and refusing it would dead-letter a bill. The enrolment is found as a pre-authorisation's is (C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer)), in force only: "No enrolment matches the patient on this claim" (`rejected`) otherwise.

**Redelivery.** A case already holding this correlation id on its claim leg ([D19. case](../database/D19-case.md) `nhcx_claim_correlation_id`, unique) is `ignored` with the case named; two deliveries racing land on the unique index.

**What the filing does.** The bill replaces the estimate rather than adding to it: the claim is the whole of what is being asked for, and adding it to the pre-authorised lines would ask for both. Every line goes in pending in round 0, whatever was decided about the estimate is cleared (adjudication `pending`), the case moves to stage `claim`, the documents are filed at phase `claim`, and the routing slip of the claim leg is written (`nhcx_claim_correlation_id`, `nhcx_claim_submission_ref`, the sender kept when the case had none). The claim carries its own discharge, so a case whose discharge nobody recorded is discharged by it rather than refused: the date from the `DSDE` or `DSCHD` supporting information or `billablePeriod.end` (today when it carries none, never before the admission), the type from the `DIS` code (`NORMAL` or `DTH` Normal Discharge; `LAMA` or `DAMA` LAMA; `DTM`, `DEATH` or `DECEASED` Deceased; `TRANSFER` or `TRF` Transfer; else Normal Discharge). A `DTM` date alone also means a death. In the sandbox a LAMA or DAMA claim and a death-case claim tick their own checklist steps [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**A case that has moved past adjudication** (stage `payment`, `settled`, `rejected`, `cancelled`) answers "That case has moved past adjudication and cannot take a claim" (`rejected`).

**Documents and forms.** As C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer): codes resolved against [D3. document_type](../database/D3-document-type.md), unknown codes filed as `ODN` with a timeline warning, inline bytes kept ([D24. case_document_file](../database/D24-case-document-file.md)), answered forms ([F7. QuestionnaireResponse](../fhir/F7-questionnaireresponse.md)) read later from the archived bundle ([A15. Case Exchange Log](../apis/A15-case-exchange.md)).

**Acknowledged at once**, for the same reason a pre-authorisation is (C4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth/payer)): [A4. Claim Answer](../apis/A4-claim-answer.md) sends outcome `queued` under workflow 25, `response.partial`, best-effort, marking nothing answered.

#### C5Q. REQUEST
`fhir` is an [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) Bundle carrying [F8. Claim](../fhir/F8-claim.md) Claim (`use: claim`, `billablePeriod`, the discharge block in `supportingInfo`, the pre-auth reference) with [F15. Patient](../fhir/F15-patient.md) Patient, [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md) Organizations, [F18. Coverage](../fhir/F18-coverage.md) Coverage, [F16. Practitioner](../fhir/F16-practitioner.md) Practitioners, [F19. Other resources](../fhir/F19-other-resources.md) Procedures and [F7. QuestionnaireResponse](../fhir/F7-questionnaireresponse.md) QuestionnaireResponses. Headers read: `x-hcx-sender_code`, `x-hcx-recipient_code`, `x-hcx-correlation_id`, `x-hcx-workflow_id` (15 claim, 161 or 151 query answer [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)).
