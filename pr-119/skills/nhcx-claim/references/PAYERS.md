# Payers

NHCX standardises the envelope, not what a payer puts in it. Package codes, the workflow id each exchange travels under, how a payer asks a question, whether it rules on authorisation requirements: these differ by payer. The application keeps them in one place, a **payer adapter**, chosen per payer participant code, and the exchange code asks the adapter instead of hard-coding a scheme. This page is that one place.

## Markers

The specs mark every statement that is not the NHCX protocol itself:

| Marker | Means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| [REF](PAYERS.md#markers) | A choice the reference implementation made (a layout, a label, an id format, a default). The protocol does not require it. | Follow it unless the target has a reason not to; record a different choice in `nhcx-plan/plan.json`. |
| [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers) | Behaviour that depends on the payer adapter (for example a PMJAY rule or a workflow id). | Read the value from the adapter below, never hard-code it; check it against the knowledge source. |
| [SANDBOX](PAYERS.md#markers) | Something observed on the NHCX sandbox or a sandbox payer, not written in any specification. | Expect it in the sandbox; do not rely on it in production without confirming it. |

Unmarked statements are the protocol or this application's own design, and are followed as written. On the protocol the knowledge source ([KNOWLEDGE.md](KNOWLEDGE.md)) wins.

## Choosing the adapter

- A configuration row maps a payer's participant code to an adapter key: in the reference implementation, rows of kind `payer_adapter` in the code lists (D8. terminology (in nhcx-coverage)), with the participant code as `code`, the operator's name for the payer as `display` and the adapter key as `extra`.
- The adapter is chosen by the policy's **payer id**. Messages are addressed to its **processing id** (the participant that handles the policy on NHCX), which can be a different code; see [CORE.md](CORE.md).
- Codes are matched on their numeric part, so `1518`, `1518@hcx` and `1518@HCX` are the same payer.
- A payer with no row is read by its **registered name** on the participant registry ([G4. Registry and Certificates](../gateway/G4-registry.md)): a name that starts with `SHA` (a State Health Agency, which runs the scheme) gets the `pmjay` adapter. The match ignores case and leading spaces. The name is learned from the payer list, or looked up once when the payer is first used and remembered; a lookup that fails is tried again after a few minutes.
- Every other payer with no row gets the **generic** adapter: a plain NRCeS bundle with none of any scheme's extras. A new payer therefore needs no configuration, and is never given the scheme's dialect unless its name says it is a State Health Agency. The claim screen names the adapter in use, so an unconfigured payer is visible.
- A configuration row always wins over the name.
- A workflow id missing from an adapter's table falls back to the PMJAY table's value for that kind; a kind no table defines is refused ("No workflow id is defined for '<kind>'.").

## The adapters

| Property | `pmjay` (PMJAY, State Health Agency) | `kyrocare` (Sandbox Payer) | `generic` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payer code system | `https://payer.pmjay.nha.gov.in` | `https://kyro.care/fhir` | `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in` |
| Programme code on every claim line | `AB-PMJAY` ("Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY)") | none | none |
| Authorisation requirements check (A2 `auth-requirements`, C3) sent on its own before a pre-authorisation or an enhancement | yes | yes | no |
| Authorisation requirements check sent by the operator ("Validate procedure set") | allowed, optional | allowed, optional | allowed, optional |
| Document stages wanted at pre-authorisation | `pre` | `pre` | `pre` |
| Publishes a package master (A3, C4) | yes | yes | yes |
| Multiple-procedure factors (`Claim.item.factor`) | 1, 0.5, 0.25 (costliest in full, second at half, the rest at a quarter) | 1, 0.5, 0.25 | none |
| How it asks for more (query mode) | `resubmit`: the query is a ClaimResponse on the case's own thread, answered by submitting the leg again under the query-response workflow id; a CommunicationRequest from it is a notification, acknowledged, never answered | `communication`: a CommunicationRequest on a thread of its own, answered with a Communication (A7) | `communication` |
| Answers a status enquiry (A6 status) | no: it refuses the Task (PAYR-1018, or PAYR-1008 with a reason code); read the case's state from its desk instead | yes | yes |
| Proof of presence (A18, S18) | required: the beneficiary's user token on the headers of the eligibility check, pre-authorisation and claim, else the Authentication Consent and Discharge Consent forms answered in the bundle; refused by name without either (PAYR-1256, PAYR-1363) | optional: the token is sent when the desk has one, nothing stands in otherwise | optional, the same |
| Reprocess reason codes | `claimrejected`, `partialpayment`, `rejectiondisputed` | same | same |
| Adjudication desk (sandbox testing, A14, A15) | the NHCX Payer Service | the sandbox payer portal's own API | none |

The `kyrocare` adapter is the reference implementation's own sandbox payer portal; it speaks the PMJAY dialect for plans and rulings. Replace it with the payers the target actually deals with.

The authorisation requirements check is not a PMJAY feature and is not required of anyone. The operator may ask any payer for a ruling; a payer with nothing to say answers without one. No pre-authorisation waits for a ruling, and the adapter only decides whether the check also goes out unasked before a send.

## Workflow ids

The `x-hcx-workflow_id` each send travels under, per adapter, and the `x-hcx-status` NHA's workflow sheet pairs it with. An environment override may replace any workflow id. The status is set by the send: a query answer goes on a request path yet travels as `response.complete`, so the gateway's path default must not decide it (the reference implementation let it, sending `request.initiated` everywhere [REF](PAYERS.md#markers)).

| Send (kind) | `pmjay` | `kyrocare` | `generic` | API | `x-hcx-status` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-authorisation (`preauth`) | 12 | 12 | 12 | A4 | `request.initiated` |
| Pre-auth resubmitted after a rejection (`preauth_resubmit`) | 121 | 121 | 121 | A4 (defined; the reference send logic never chooses it) | `request.initiated` |
| Pre-auth query answer (`preauth_query_response`) | 19 | 19 | 19 | A4 | `response.complete` |
| Enhancement (`enhancement`) | 13 | 13 | 13 | A4 | `request.initiated` |
| Enhancement query answer (`enhancement_resubmit`) | 131 | 131 | 131 | A4 | `response.complete` |
| Predetermination | 12 | 12 | 12 | A4 | `request.initiated` |
| Cancel (`cancel`) | PC01 | PC01 | PC01 | A6 | `request.initiated` |
| Claim (`claim`) | 15 | 15 | 15 | A5 | `request.initiated` |
| Claim resubmitted (`claim_resubmit`) | not offered: PMJAY refuses 16 with PAYR-1321 [SANDBOX](PAYERS.md#markers) | 16, not in NHA's published workflow list [REF](PAYERS.md#markers) | 16, not in NHA's published workflow list [REF](PAYERS.md#markers) | A5 | `request.initiated` |
| Claim query answer (`claim_query_response`) | 161: the SHA sandbox refuses the handbook's 151 and 19 with PAYR-1321 and takes 161 [SANDBOX](PAYERS.md#markers) | 151 | 151 | A5 | `response.complete` |
| Payment acknowledgement (`payment_ack`) | 17 | the notice's own workflow id, echoed back | the notice's own workflow id | A8 | `response.complete` |
| Reprocess (`reprocess`) | 36 | 36 | 36 | A6 | `request.initiated` |
| Balance release (`release`) | 36 | 36 | 36 | A6 | `request.initiated` |

Eligibility checks (A2) and plan requests (A3) do not take their workflow id from this table: the reference implementation sends the case number [REF](PAYERS.md#markers). NHA publishes no eligibility workflow code; its sample sends `11` (Patient Admitted). Prefer `11` unless the payer is known to accept the case number. A status enquiry sends the leg's own correlation id, else 13 [REF](PAYERS.md#markers). Confirm both against the knowledge source (`workflow.yaml` in the package).

The payer's replies carry workflow ids of their own [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers). The callbacks never route on them; they match on correlation ids. They do read them for the **status**: when a reply's `x-hcx-workflow_id` is one of the payer-side codes below, that code says what the reply is, and the bundle is read for the amounts and words only. A workflow id outside the list (a case number echoed back, for example) says nothing, and the bundle decides as [F9. ClaimResponse](../fhir/F9-claimresponse.md) describes.

| Reply workflow id | Leg status |
|---|---|
| 20, 25, 18, 251, 28, 29, 37 | `submitting`: received and under adjudication, an acknowledgement |
| 21, 22, 26, 252 | `approved` (`partial` when the bundle says the approval is partial) |
| 23, 231, 291, 253 | `rejected` |
| 24, 241, 27, 254 | `queried` |

An error wins over both: a reply with `x-hcx-status` `response.error`, a `ClaimResponse.error`, or an `error` outcome that is not a rejection is an error whatever its workflow id (see [F9. ClaimResponse](../fhir/F9-claimresponse.md)).

## Use case

Every pre-authorisation and claim send carries `x-hcx-use_case`, to every payer, whether or not the payer reads it. It is the same for all adapters.

| Send (kind) | `x-hcx-use_case` |
|---|---|
| `preauth`, predetermination, `claim` | `New` |
| `enhancement` | `Enhancement` |
| `preauth_resubmit`, `preauth_query_response`, `enhancement_resubmit`, `claim_query_response`, `claim_resubmit` | `Resubmit` |

## Sandbox participant codes

Seen in the reference implementation's sandbox runs [SANDBOX](PAYERS.md#markers). They are examples, not constants: a build reads every participant code from configuration.

| Code | Is |
|---|---|
| `1518@hcx` | the PMJAY (NHA) payer on the NHCX sandbox, adapter `pmjay` |
| `1000004805@hcx` | the reference implementation's IRDAI sandbox payer portal, adapter `kyrocare` |

## Test participants

The end-to-end tests ([TESTS.md](TESTS.md)) run against two payers. The values below are the defaults the test configuration ([T1. Test Configuration](../tests/T1-test-configuration.md)) starts from, except where the table says otherwise.

| Test payer | Participant code | Adapter | Adjudication desk (A14, A15) | Member id | Variable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| IRDAI test payer | `1000004957@hcx` (Sandbox Payer NHA) | `kyrocare` | IRDAI payer desk (`irdai-payer`), fixed at `https://nhcxai.abdm.gov.in/uat/` (API at `/api/payer`), signed in to by token login | `MRAJ2004001` | `NHCX_TEST_IRDAI_PAYER`, `NHCX_TEST_IRDAI_MEMBER_ID` |
| PMJAY test payer | `1518@hcx` (PMJAY, NHA) | `pmjay` | NHCX Payer Service (`nhcx-payer-service`) | asked from the integrator, no default | `NHCX_TEST_PMJAY_PAYER`, `NHCX_TEST_PMJAY_MEMBER_ID` |

**The IRDAI payer desk is fixed.** It is not a setting and has no variable: its screens are at `https://nhcxai.abdm.gov.in/uat/`, its API at `https://nhcxai.abdm.gov.in/api/payer`. It is signed in to only by token login, with the facility's own ABDM session token (A14): there is no username, password or desk account to configure or ask for.

**PMJAY needs one value only the integrator has**: a PMJAY beneficiary's member id that the sandbox knows. It is asked from the integrator ([T1. Test Configuration](../tests/T1-test-configuration.md)), never guessed or taken from an example, and a PMJAY test without it is `blocked` with that reason. The beneficiary's ABHA number is not asked for: the registry returns it with the policy (A1. Policy Search (in nhcx-coverage)). The facility's HFR id is not asked for either: it is the one on the facility's own record ([D1. organization](../database/D1-organization.md)), which every bundle already carries.

**PMJAY's package master is slow and is not waited for.** The PMJAY sandbox answers an insurance plan request (A3. Insurance Plan Request (in nhcx-preauth)) in 15 to 60 minutes, often about 30, and refuses a second request for the same policy meanwhile (PAYR-1406) [SANDBOX](PAYERS.md#markers). The tests request it once and move on: they run on a seeded package master instead (T13. PMJAY Eligibility, Package Master and Ruling (in nhcx-coverage)).
