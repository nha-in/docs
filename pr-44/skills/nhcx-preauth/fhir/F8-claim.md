# F8. Claim

#### F8R. RESOURCE
`Claim`, profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Claim`, the anchor (`entry[0]`) of a bundle with profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/ClaimBundle` (F1). Direction: sent.

#### F8D. DESCRIPTION
One Claim document serves every leg of the episode: pre-authorisation, enhancement, predetermination, claim, and the answer to a payer query on any of them. What differs between legs is the anchor, `use`, the Procedure status, the discharge information, `preAuthRef`, the query answer and which documents and forms ride.

**Bundle entries**, in this order (F1):

| # | `fullUrl` | Resource | `id` | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | the anchor (table below) | Claim | the claim number | this file |
| 2 | `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/patient` | Patient | `1` | F15 |
| 3 | `.../provider` | Organization, facility | `1` | F17 |
| 4 | `.../payer` | Organization, payer | `2` | F17 |
| 5 | `.../coverage` | Coverage | `1` | F18 |
| 6 | `.../practitioner`, then `.../practitioner/2`, ... | Practitioner, one per care-team member | `1`, `2`, ... | F16 |
| 7 | `.../procedure/1`, `.../procedure/2`, ... | Procedure, one per procedure item | `1`, `2`, ... | F19 |
| 8 | `.../questionnaireresponse/1`, ... | QuestionnaireResponse, one per answered form | `1`, `2`, ... | F7 |

Every resource and every Claim list element carries an `id`, because PMJAY's payer service reads them by id and refuses an item without one (PAYR-1027 "invalid item id") [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Variants.**

| Send kind (A4, A5) | `use` | Anchor | Bundle `id` | Procedure status (F19) | Adds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-authorisation | `preauthorization` | `/preauth/request` | `preauth-request-generic` | `preparation` | |
| Enhancement | `preauthorization` | `/preauth/enhancement` | `preauth-enhancement-request-generic` | `preparation` | every quoted line, old and new |
| Pre-authorisation query answer, enhancement query answer | `preauthorization` | `/preauth/queryupdate` | `preauth-queryupdate-request-generic` | `preparation` | `NMI` / `CQD` answer |
| Predetermination | `predetermination` | `/predetermination/request` | `predetermination-request-generic` | `preparation` | no QuestionnaireResponse |
| Claim, claim resubmit | `claim` | `/claim/request` | `claim-request-generic` | `completed` | discharge, `preAuthRef` |
| Claim query answer | `claim` | `/claim/queryupdate` | `claim-queryupdate-request-generic` | `completed` | discharge, `preAuthRef`, `NMI` / `CQD` answer |

The workflow id (`x-hcx-workflow_id`) is what tells the payer which round it is (A4, A5; values in [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). An enhancement goes under the same claim number, with no `related` link.

**Lines to items.** The quoted lines are D16 `claim_line`, read in `kind`, `seq` order (so implants come before procedures). One `item` per procedure or implant line. A ward or ICU tier (a `Stratification` line) is **not** an item: it rides as a `modifier` on the item of the procedure whose code is the tier's `parent_code`, else the first procedure, and that item's `net` carries the procedure and its tiers together [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). A tier with no procedure at all becomes an item of its own. `unitPrice` is `net / quantity`, so FHIR's arithmetic holds.

`factor` is the multiple-procedure rule, where the payer's adapter has one (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)): procedure items ranked by their own line amount (tiers not counted), the costliest at 1, the second at 0.5, the rest at 0.25 [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Implant items carry no factor. Generic payers get no `factor`.

**Claim leg differences.**
- The lines are the claim's lines. A LAMA or DAMA discharge at stage "Before Surgery" or "During Surgery" collapses them to one procedure line `LM100` (display and rate from the plan's `LM100` package, else "LAMA / DAMA procedure" at 0; category from the plan, else from the first quoted line), because the payer disqualifies every other item (PAYR-1362) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- `billablePeriod.end` is the discharge date (else the admission date).
- `insurance[0].preAuthRef` is the payer's pre-authorisation reference.
- Documents are those filed at the claim stage. The discharge summary goes as the `HDS` entry: the claim-stage document whose code is a required claim document with "discharge summary" in its display, else the latest document coded `HDS`. It goes under that document's own code (for example PMJAY's `MAND0006` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)).
- Discharge scalars follow the documents (table in F8F).

**Supporting information order.** Numbered from 1 in this order: documents; the discharge summary (claim); `ADDD`; `EDT`; `PSP` (claim, when a surgery date is given); `DSDE` (claim); `DTM` (claim, death only); `DIS` (claim); `CQD` (query answers); one pointer per QuestionnaireResponse (F7). Documents given as a form answer are not listed here: they ride inside the QuestionnaireResponse.

**Refusals before sending** are listed in A4 and A5 (eligible policy, linked admission, admission date, at least one diagnosis, care-team member and line; a query answer needs reply text; a claim needs a discharge mode and an approved or queried pre-authorisation).

**Read back.** The last pre-authorisation bundle sent (D18 `claim_preauth.request_json`) is read again to find which lines are new: every `item[].productOrService` code and every `modifier` code in it counts as sent. A line whose code is not there makes an enhancement due.
