# A2. Coverage Eligibility Check

#### A2E. ENDPOINT
In-process: `gateway.send("v1/coverageeligibility/check", envelope)`, [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md). G7 encrypts and posts it to NHCX: `POST {nhcx}/v1/coverageeligibility/check`. The payer answers asynchronously with `v1/coverageeligibility/on_check`, taken in by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) and handed to the callback door C1 (type `coverage`), or found by polling the [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md) (A10 to A13).

#### A2D. DESCRIPTION
Sends a `CoverageEligibilityRequest` bundle to the payer. The app builds the bundle itself; G7 only completes the headers, encrypts and dispatches it. The call returns NHCX's acceptance only; the verdict arrives later on the same correlation id.

One bundle shape serves four purposes:

| Purpose | Asked when | Policy code | `item[]` | Stored on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `validation` | at registration: is the policy in force? | required | none | the case |
| `benefits` | before a pre-authorisation or an enhancement: what does the policy cover for this package? | required | the lines quoted so far, when there are any | the case |
| `discovery` | an indemnity payer, when the policy is not yet known: find active coverage | optional (`NONE` in the bundle) | none | the case |
| `auth-requirements` | on the chosen procedure set, before a pre-authorisation and again before an enhancement | the case's, `NONE` if it has none | the quoted procedure set, required | the ruling (`claim_auth`), not the case |

The first three are the eligibility check, sent from the check form with the operator's purpose, policy code and member ID. `auth-requirements` is the procedure-set ruling, sent two ways:
- by the operator ("Validate procedure set");
- automatically, and never waited on, just before a pre-authorisation or enhancement is submitted (A4), when the case is eligible, has lines, the payer's adapter answers this check, and the set has not already been asked about (a ruling not in error whose fingerprint equals the current set). A failure of this automatic send is swallowed and the pre-authorisation goes anyway.

JWE headers: the app sets only these three; G7 generates ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)) `x-hcx-api_call_id`, `x-hcx-request_id`, `x-hcx-correlation_id`, `x-hcx-timestamp` and `x-hcx-status`.
- `x-hcx-sender_code`: the facility's NHCX participant code (Settings).
- `x-hcx-recipient_code`: the policy's `processing_id` from the policy search (A1), else its `payer_id`, else the configured default payer code. NHA's documentation is explicit that the recipient is the processing id, not the payer id (NHCX-1003 otherwise) (in the reference implementation the PMJAY payer, see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- `x-hcx-workflow_id`: the case number, for every purpose [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). NHA publishes no eligibility workflow code; its sample sends `11` (Patient Admitted). The payer adapter decides which to send: take `11` unless the payer is known to accept the case number. It groups every leg of the episode on both sides. (The adapter's workflow-id table is not used for this call; confirm the value against the knowledge source, see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md).)

Refused before any call, eligibility check (in this order):
- "Claim not found."
- purpose not validation, benefits or discovery: "Choose whether this check is a validation, a benefits check or a discovery."
- "Member ID is required for an eligibility check."
- "Policy code is required for a validation check." / "Policy code is required for a benefits check."
- "Set the facility's HFR ID under Settings before raising claims."
- "Set the facility's NHCX participant code under Settings before raising claims."

Refused before any call, auth-requirements:
- "Claim not found."
- case not `eligible`: "Check the policy's eligibility before validating a procedure set against it."
- adapter without the check: "<adapter name> does not answer authorisation requirement checks."
- no lines: "Choose the line items first, this checks the procedure set, so there has to be one."
- "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings before checking requirements."

The bundle builder itself refuses a bundle without a member id ("A coverage check needs the member id to ask about."), without the facility registry id ("A coverage check needs the facility's registry id.") or without a payer code ("A coverage check needs the payer's participant code.").

#### A2Q. REQUEST

The envelope's fields are the arguments passed to G7 Send.

| Field | Type | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jwe_headers.x-hcx-sender_code` | string | yes | facility participant code |
| `jwe_headers.x-hcx-recipient_code` | string | yes | payer participant code |
| `jwe_headers.x-hcx-workflow_id` | string | yes | case number [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) |
| `fhir` | object | yes | the `CoverageEligibilityRequest` bundle |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md), [F2. CoverageEligibilityRequest](../fhir/F2-coverage-eligibility-request.md), [F15. Patient](../fhir/F15-patient.md), [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md), [F18. Coverage](../fhir/F18-coverage.md), [F16. Practitioner and PractitionerRole](../fhir/F16-practitioner.md), [F19. Other bundle resources](../fhir/F19-other-resources.md) (Location)

Envelope, an auth-requirements check from a case file:

```json
{
 "jwe_headers": {
  "x-hcx-sender_code": "<facility code>",
  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<payer code>",
  "x-hcx-workflow_id": "NM-26-0SH000006"
 },
 "fhir": <F1 Bundle carrying F2 CoverageEligibilityRequest (purpose auth-requirements), F15 Patient, F17 provider and payer Organizations, F19 Location, F18 Coverage, F16 PractitionerRole>
}
```

A validation or discovery check is the same envelope with its own purpose and no `item`.

#### A2S. RESPONSE
Acknowledgement, the G7 result:

```
{"ok": true, "gateway_status": 202, "txn_id": "01M07CJ...", "ledger_id": "01M07CJ...",
 "correlation_id": "<uuid>", "request_id": "<uuid>",
 "headers": {"x-hcx-correlation_id": "<uuid>", ...}, "response": <NHCX's acceptance>, ...}
```

The ids (`txn_id`, `correlation_id`) are stored on the leg (the case for the first three purposes, the ruling for auth-requirements), the leg goes to `checking` and any earlier error is cleared. A re-asked ruling drops the previous ruling's items and requirements. NHCX itself answers G7 `202 request.queued`.

A failed send that names its ids keeps them on the leg, sets it to `error` with the G7 error's message (or NHCX's refusal when `ok` is false), and raises the error (shared convention). A failed send naming no ids leaves the leg as it was.

Data: [D9. claim](../database/D9-claim.md), [D13. claim_auth](../database/D13-claim-auth.md), [D14. claim_auth_item](../database/D14-claim-auth-item.md), [D15. claim_auth_requirement](../database/D15-claim-auth-requirement.md)

Reply: C2. Coverage Eligibility Verdict (in nhcx-coverage) (validation, benefits, discovery), [C3. Authorisation Requirements Ruling](../callbacks/C3-auth-requirements-on-check.md) (auth-requirements)

- A dispatch that failed (for example `CERT_NOT_FOUND` for an unregistered recipient) comes back from G7 at once as a failed send under its ids; A11 reads the same outcome from the G9 ledger.
