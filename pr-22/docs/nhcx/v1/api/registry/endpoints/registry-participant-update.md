# Submit the participant update (v1)

`POST /participant/update`

Updates a participant's registry record; participant_code and roles are mandatory, every other field (certificate, endpoint, contacts, status) is optional.

### Business purpose

Participant details change over the life of an integration: callback endpoints move, encryption certificates are rotated annually, contact numbers and payment details change. The registry is the source of truth that the gateway routes from, so those changes must land there, not just in the participant's own configuration. This v1 update lets an organisation amend any attribute of its full record in one synchronous call, and the sandbox onboarding document names it as the way to update the bridge URL, the encryption certificate or any other attribute.

### When to use

Use it after registration whenever a registry attribute must change. The FAQ lists the sandbox Update Participant URL as https://apisbx.ABDM.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice/participant/update, while production onboarding documents the narrower /v2/participant/update plus /update/validate for certificate and bridge changes. It is a plain JSON registry call outside the JWE protocol, with no workflow or x-hcx-status codes. For a certificate-only change without passcode validation, /v2/update/cert is the documented shortcut.

### Preconditions

- The participant already exists and you hold its participant_code.
- Bearer token with the Bearer prefix in bearer_auth, plus Accept and Content-Type: application/json.
- Body per ParticipantUpdateBody: participant_code and roles are the only required fields; participant_name, scheme_code, linked_registry_codes, address, contact fields, status, signing_cert_path, encryption_cert, endpoint_URL and payment_details are optional.
- If updating encryption_cert, the new certificate is Base64-encoded and its private key is already deployed on the callback host.
- Linked registry codes must validate.

### Postconditions

HTTP 200 with a string body (the OpenAPI declares string; the sandbox onboarding document shows the participant code echoed back, for example 100001@sbx). The registry record now carries the amended values, and because the gateway reads endpoint_URL and encryption_cert from the registry on every leg, callback routing and counterparties' certificate fetches reflect the change from the next call onwards, subject to their 24-hour certificate cache. No asynchronous callback follows. Failures use the 400/404/500 ErrorResponse envelope.

### Common mistakes

- Omitting roles on a partial update; it is required even when the change has nothing to do with roles, and its absence yields a 400.
- Copying v2 field names (participantcode, encryptioncert, endpointurl) into this snake_case body.
- Setting an endpoint_URL that uses an IP address or port, or a server outside India, which breaks callback delivery at go-live.
- Rotating the certificate in the registry before the new private key is live on the callback host, so inbound callbacks can no longer be decrypted.
- Missing the Accept header or the Bearer prefix.

### Best practices

- Read the current record with /participant/search first and send the full intended state, so a partial body does not unintentionally blank optional fields.
- Rotate certificates in two phases and keep the old private key for at least 24 hours, the documented certificate cache TTL.
- Confirm callback reachability (domain name, India-based host, NAT IPs 3.109.99.210, 13.126.152.0 and 13.200.129.223 whitelisted) before pointing endpoint_URL at a new host.
- Log the change with who requested it; registry changes affect where encrypted health data is delivered.

### Related scenario

A hospital migrates its claims callback service to a new domain. Before touching the registry the team deploys the service, verifies the NHCX NAT IPs are whitelisted and copies the existing PKCS8 private key across. They fetch a Bearer token via /get/session, read the current record with /participant/search, and call /participant/update with participant_code, roles and the new endpoint_URL. The registry returns 200. The next /v1/preauth/on_submit callback from the payer arrives at the new domain and is acknowledged with 202 within 30 seconds.

### Specification

Chapter [Your certificate](/docs/nhcx/v1/getting-started/your-certificate) of the NHCX integration specification.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice/participant/update \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSIONS_CALL>' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <access token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "participant_code": "<participant code>",
  "participant_name": "Test Hospital",
  "scheme_code": "PMJAY",
  "roles": [
    "10001"
  ],
  "primaryEmail": "integration@hospital.example",
  "phone": [
    "01123456789"
  ],
  "primaryMobile": "9876543210",
  "endpoint_url": "https://nhcx.hospital.example",
  "signing_cert_path": "",
  "encryption_cert": "<encryption cert>"
}'
```

## Authorization

- `Authorization` (bearer token, required): On every NHCX call, the token goes in a header called `bearer_auth`, with the word `Bearer` and a space in front. The sources are not unanimous: the authentication page and the FAQ both write the example as `Authorization`, and the notification endpoint uses `Authorization`. The safe course, and what the adapter does, is to send both headers with the same value.

## Headers

- `bearer_auth` (string, required): It is `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`, on NHCX's own endpoints.

## Body

- `participant_code` (string)
- `participant_name` (string)
- `scheme_code` (string)
- `roles` (string[])
- `primaryEmail` (string)
- `phone` (string[])
- `primaryMobile` (string)
- `endpoint_url` (string)
- `signing_cert_path` (string)
- `encryption_cert` (string)

## Responses

- `200`: HTTP 200 with a string body (the OpenAPI declares string; the sandbox onboarding document shows the participant code echoed back, for example 100001@sbx).
