# Claim submit (internal) (adapter)

`POST /internal/v1/claim/submit`

Internal twin of /v1/claim/submit (operationId claimSubmitPostInternal) with the same JWEPayload body and response set.

### Business purpose

The claim service publishes its submit operation twice, at /v1 and at /internal/v1. Both let a provider submit or resubmit the final claim bundle for adjudication and settlement. The internal path is documented only as a distinct operationId on the same contract; no separate business purpose is described for it.

### When to use

Documented as the internal variant of claim submit, consumed by providers with a JWEPayload body. The same workflow discriminators apply: 15 for the final claim, 151 for a claim query response, with x-hcx-use_case New or Resubmit and x-hcx-status request.initiated. The OpenAPI specs expose this operation twice, at /v1/... and at /internal/v1/..., with identical descriptions, request bodies and response sets; only the operationId differs (an Internal suffix). The specs do not document what makes the internal variant different beyond that suffix, so treat it as a mirror of the public path and integrate against the public /v1 path unless NHCX onboarding tells you otherwise.

### Preconditions

Identical to /v1/claim/submit: an approved preauth for the case, Claim.use set to claim with preAuthRef and final amounts, the complete document set and discharge information, PMJAY authentication or consent questionnaire, a valid Bearer token, the payer certificate, JWE encryption and a fresh correlation ID. Nothing additional is documented for the internal route.

### Postconditions

Same as the public path: HTTP 202 Accepted with a StatusSuccessResponse acknowledgement, asynchronous forwarding to the payer, and one or more ClaimResponseBundles on the claim callback (the internal twin /internal/v1/claim/on_submit exists with the same body). 400, 404 and 500 carry the same schema.

### Common mistakes

- Assuming a different body or semantics for the internal route; the spec gives it the same JWEPayload body and responses.
- Using it without confirmation from NHCX onboarding and then chasing a 404; try the alternate host and prefix shape before escalating.
- Every public claim-submit pitfall applies unchanged: no approved preauth (PAYR-1302), duplicate claim (PAYR-1301), amount above the approved preauth (PAYR-1012), wrong workflow ID (PAYR-1321), reused correlation ID (NHCX-1006).

### Best practices

- Default to /v1/claim/submit and keep the internal path as a configuration option only.
- Share one client implementation across both paths so header hygiene, encryption and correlation handling cannot diverge.
- Record which variant carried each correlation ID for support conversations.

### Related scenario

A hospital's HMIS vendor reading the claimhcxservice OpenAPI notices claimSubmitPost and claimSubmitPostInternal side by side. They implement a single claim client against /v1/claim/submit, parameterise the base path, and ask NHCX support whether the internal twin is relevant to their deployment. The end-to-end flow is unchanged: the claim goes out under workflow 15 after discharge, returns a 202, and the payer's adjudication arrives on the claim callback.
