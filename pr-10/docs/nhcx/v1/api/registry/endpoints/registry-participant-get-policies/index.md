# Get beneficiary policies

`POST /participant/get/policies`

Looks up the policies linked to a beneficiary by ABHA number, member id or mobile number, returning the payer and product details needed for claims.

### Business purpose

This is the provider's window into the member layer that payers populate through the link API. A hospital cannot submit a coverage-eligibility check, preauthorisation or claim until it knows the payer participant code, member id and product for the patient, and this call is where those values come from. The handbook lists policy discovery as step three of the fixed cashless sequence (payer search, payer selection, policy discovery, cache normalisation, effective payer resolution, InsurancePlan retrieval, optional eligibility, preauth). Payers and TPAs also use it to verify that their links were recorded.

### When to use

Call it after patient registration or admission, when the desk needs to confirm that the patient is linked to a scheme or policy, and again (with a forced refresh) whenever a payer-side change is suspected. It precedes /v1/insuranceplan/request, /v1/coverageeligibility/check and /v1/preauth/submit (workflow code 12). If no payer id can be derived from the result, the backend must refuse preauth with "Unable to resolve payerId from policy bundle. Please fetch eligibility/policies before pre-auth submission." It is use case 2 in both the provider and payer sandbox exit checklists.

### Preconditions

- A valid Bearer token from the client-credentials call (POST /get/session, form-urlencoded client_id, client_secret, grant_type=client_credentials); tokens last 1200 seconds, so refresh before expiry.
- HTTP headers Accept: application/json, Content-Type: application/json and bearer_auth: Bearer <token> (the participant service uses bearer_auth, not Authorization).
- Base path for the participant service: https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice (sandbox) or https://apisprod.nha.gov.in/pmjay/hcx/participanthcxservice (production).
- This is a synchronous plain-JSON registry call: no JWE envelope, no x-hcx-* protocol headers and no correlation id are involved.
- The beneficiary must already have been linked by the payer or TPA; if no link exists the lookup returns nothing regardless of the hospital's own records.
- Body is FetchParticipantPoliciesRequest with two required strings: identifiertype (AbhaNumber, MemberId or MobileNo) and identifiervalue; ABHA must be supplied without hyphens.

### Postconditions

The service answers synchronously with HTTP 200 and ParticipantListResponse: an optional participantdetails array whose entries carry optional participantcode, participantname, address and state. No callback follows. Integrators cache the normalised result keyed by patient (the handbook documents this cache as permanent, with forceRefresh: true as the only bypass) and resolve payerId, memberId, productId, productName and policyNumber from it. NHA guidance stresses that the processingID in the response, not the PayerID, is what goes into x-hcx-recipient_code. Failures return 400, 404 or 500 with the ErrorResponse envelope.

### Common mistakes

- Sending the ABHA number with hyphens; the identifier table specifies ABHA without hyphens for this lookup and a hyphenated value is a common cause of an empty result.
- Using the PayerID from the response as x-hcx-recipient_code; NHA's common mistake 7 says providers must use the processingID from the get/Policies response as the receiver code, otherwise NHCX-1003 (receiver not registered) or PAYR-1331 follows.
- Trying only one identifier type; the handbook prescribes a cascade of AbhaNumber, then MemberId, then MobileNo.
- Dereferencing fields blindly; every field of ParticipantDetails is optional and the response shape may arrive as participantdetails, participants or a raw array.
- Trusting a permanent policy cache after a payer-side change instead of passing forceRefresh: true.

### Best practices

- Normalise the ABHA number (strip separators) before the call and try identifiers in the documented priority order: ABHA, then MemberId from the latest admission, then mobile number.
- Cache successful lookups keyed by patient, but expose a forceRefresh path and use it as the first diagnostic step when a preauth is rejected for a coverage mismatch.
- Store payerId, memberId, productId, productName and policyNumber from the result; these feed x-hcx-recipient_code, the Coverage and Patient identifiers and the InsurancePlan lookup.
- If the lookup yields nothing, fall back to a coverage-eligibility check with purpose discovery to obtain the active policy code.
- Keep the token fresh; retry once on 401.

### Related scenario

A patient is admitted to a network hospital and the registration desk captures an ABHA number and a member id. The HMIS has already called /fetch/participants/list to discover payers, and now calls /participant/get/policies with identifiertype AbhaNumber and the hyphen-free ABHA value. The response is normalised and cached against the patient, and the processingID becomes the receiver code. The desk then requests the plan through /v1/insuranceplan/request, optionally runs /v1/coverageeligibility/check, and submits the preauthorisation with /v1/preauth/submit; when the payer later queries a coverage detail, the desk forces a refresh of this lookup before responding.
