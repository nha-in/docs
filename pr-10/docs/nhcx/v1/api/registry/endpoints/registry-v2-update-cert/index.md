# Update certificate (v2, no passcode)

`POST /v2/update/cert`

Replaces a participant's public encryption certificate by participantId without passcode validation; the same schema is echoed back on success.

### Business purpose

Encryption keys are recommended to be rotated once a year, and a compromised key must be replaced immediately. The passcode-gated /v2/participant/update is the safer general route, but it needs a person with the registered phone and a 24-hour confirmation step. This endpoint exists for certificate-only updates without that validation, so an organisation can publish a new public certificate quickly. Only the certificate changes; the endpoint URL is untouched.

### When to use

Use it for scheduled annual rotation or emergency replacement of the certificate when passcode validation is not wanted. The production URL is https://apisprod.nha.gov.in/pmjay/hcx/participanthcxservice/v2/update/cert. To change the callback URL as well, use /v2/participant/update instead. It is the last item of the certificates checklist alongside the v2 participant update. Synchronous JSON; no workflow or x-hcx-status codes.

### Preconditions

- Bearer token from /get/session in bearer_auth with the Bearer prefix; Accept and Content-Type: application/json.
- UpdateCertV2 body: participantId and certificate, both mandatory; the certificate must be Base64-encoded (the NHA steps produce a self-signed X.509 RSA certificate, then Base64-encode the whole PEM text).
- The matching new private key, in PKCS8 form, is already deployed on the callback host.
- Note the camelCase field participantId, unlike participant_code (v1) and participantcode (v2 update).

### Postconditions

HTTP 200 with the UpdateCertV2 schema echoed back (participantId and certificate). The registry's encryption certificate for that participant is replaced, so /fetch/certs returns the new one from the next call; counterparties may serve a cached copy for up to 24 hours. No transactionid is issued and no /update/validate step follows. No callback. 400, 404 and 500 use the ErrorResponse envelope.

### Common mistakes

- Sending the raw PEM rather than the Base64-encoded certificate, which the validation explicitly requires.
- Using participant_code, participantcode or encryptioncert; this schema is participantId and certificate.
- Publishing the new certificate before the new private key is live on the callback host, so inbound callbacks fail to decrypt (PAYR-1001 on the counterparty side, undecryptable payloads on yours).
- Discarding the old private key immediately, even though counterparties can hold the old certificate for 24 hours.
- Trying to change the endpoint URL here; only the certificate is accepted.

### Best practices

- Rotate in two phases: deploy the new PKCS8 private key, publish the certificate, and keep the old key for at least 24 hours.
- Generate a 2048-bit RSA key and a 365-day self-signed X.509 certificate so the validity matches the annual rotation recommendation.
- Verify with /participant/search or a /fetch/certs call against your own code that the new certificate is served.
- Restrict who can call this endpoint inside your organisation, since it replaces the key that protects all inbound health data without a passcode.
- Notify the ecosystem promptly if rotation is due to suspected compromise, as the protocol expects.

### Related scenario

A hospital's security audit finds its NHCX private key was copied to a shared drive. The team generates a new 2048-bit RSA key pair and 365-day self-signed certificate, deploys the PKCS8 private key to the callback host and Base64-encodes the certificate. With a Bearer token they call /v2/update/cert with participantId XXXXX7583@hcx and the certificate; the registry echoes the schema back. They keep the old key available for one day so payers still holding the cached certificate can be decrypted, then destroy it. The next /v1/preauth/on_submit from the payer, encrypted against the new certificate, decrypts cleanly.
