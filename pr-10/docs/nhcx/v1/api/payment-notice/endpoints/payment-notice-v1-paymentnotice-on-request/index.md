# Payment notice acknowledgement

`POST /v1/paymentnotice/on_request`

Provider acknowledges a payment notice with a Task bundle (status completed, output paymentack), closing the payment lifecycle via NHCX.

### Business purpose

The acknowledgement confirms to the payer that the provider has received and recorded the payment notice for a specific claim. It closes the payment lifecycle from the provider side and completes the audit trail from claim approval through settlement. Failure to acknowledge does not block the payer, but the acknowledgement is required for complete lifecycle tracking, which matters for reconciliation, dispute resolution and scheme reporting.

### When to use

Called by the provider after processing a /v1/paymentnotice/request message, using the same correlation ID, with x-hcx-workflow_id 17 PAYMENT_RECEIVED and x-hcx-status response.complete (the NHA sheet lists 17 Payment Notice Received as response.complete). The plaintext is a Task with status completed, intent order, code status from the HL7 financialtaskcode system, output[0] paymentack (Payment is acknowledged) and output[1] claimNumber carrying the acknowledged claim number; Task.requester is the provider and Task.owner the payer, the reverse of the notice. The handbook narrative alternatively places this acknowledgement on /v1/task/submit; the OpenAPI contract and the Payment use-case document support this endpoint.

### Preconditions

- A payment notice with this correlation ID has been received and acknowledged with 202 (NHCX-1010 if NHCX has no record of it).
- The provider holds a valid Bearer token and the payer's certificate, and encrypts the acknowledgement Task for the payer.
- x-hcx-correlation_id echoes the notice; x-hcx-api_call_id is new; the provider is sender and the payer is recipient.
- Task.output[0].valueCodeableConcept.coding.code is paymentack and Task.output[1].valueString is the claim number from the notice; Task.status is completed.
- x-hcx-status is response.complete, or response.error with x-hcx-error_details for a protocol-level problem.

### Postconditions

NHCX returns HTTP 202 Accepted with a StatusSuccessResponse acknowledgement (entity_type payment) and forwards the Task to the payer asynchronously; the payer's endpoint must acknowledge with 202 within 30 seconds or NHCX retries up to five times. If the payer cannot process the acknowledgement (invalid provider, decryption failure, missing mandatory protocol attributes) it returns a protocol response with x-hcx-error_details populated. On success the payment lifecycle for that claim is closed on both sides.

### Common mistakes

- Sending the acknowledgement as a JWEPayload of a different resource type or with the workbook's alternative output text (ACKNOWLEDGED, RECEIVED) instead of paymentack.
- Keeping the notice's Task direction; on the acknowledgement requester must be the provider and owner the payer.
- Minting a new correlation ID instead of echoing the notice's, or reusing a correlation ID that NHCX has deleted after failed deliveries.
- Using the wrong status; the response leg carries response.complete, not request.initiated.
- Skipping the acknowledgement altogether because the payer is not blocked by it, which leaves the lifecycle open in NHCX tracking.
- Payer side: returning 200 or a non-conforming body on receipt, which is treated as an error and retried.

### Best practices

- Send the acknowledgement only after the UTR, TDS and net amount have been persisted against the claim.
- Echo the claim number from PaymentNotice.identifier (type CLN) into Task.output[1].valueString so the payer can match it without decrypting the original.
- Confirm with the payer during onboarding whether it expects the acknowledgement here or on /v1/task/submit, given the documented source conflict.
- Be idempotent: if the same notice is redelivered, acknowledge again with the same content rather than creating a second ledger entry.
- Log api_call_id and correlation ID for the acknowledgement so the closed lifecycle can be evidenced.

### Related scenario

The hospital finance team receives the settlement notice under workflow 33 for claim CL0000000001 with UTR UTR000000000001, net 2187 INR and TDS 243 INR. After matching the bank credit and persisting the UTR, the HMIS builds a Task with status completed, code status, output paymentack and claimNumber CL0000000001, encrypts it for the payer and posts it to /v1/paymentnotice/on_request under workflow 17 with the notice's correlation ID. NHCX returns 202 and delivers it to the payer's bridge, which acknowledges within 30 seconds; the claim is now closed on both ledgers.
