# Predetermination: deliver the answer

`POST /v1/predetermination/on_submit`

Answer with what the payer would approve. Defined by the specification and never observed in a published payload.

The body is one JSON object with a single `payload` field carrying the JWE. The exchange answers `202 Accepted` with a receipt; the decision arrives later on the matching callback.

Workflow codes: none listed.
