# Search: send the request

`POST /v1/search/submit`

Search claim information across payers. A provider may search only its own cases; a regulator or scheme sponsor may search any.

The body is one JSON object with a single `payload` field carrying the JWE. The exchange answers `202 Accepted` with a receipt; the decision arrives later on the matching callback.

Workflow codes: none listed.

```bash
curl --request POST \

  --data '{
