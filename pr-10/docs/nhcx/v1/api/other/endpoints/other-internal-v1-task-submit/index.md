# Task submit (internal variant) (adapter)

`POST /internal/v1/task/submit`

Internal twin of /v1/task/submit on the taskhcxservice, operationId hcxTaskPostInternal, with the same JWEPayload Task body and 202 envelope.

### Business purpose

The taskhcxservice is one of six NHCX services that publish each operation at both /v1/... and /internal/v1/... with identical descriptions and request bodies, differing only in the operationId suffix. This is the internal form of the provider's reprocess or cancel request: the structured appeal path for rejected or short-paid claims and the withdrawal path for unused pre-authorisations. The specifications document no behavioural difference from the public endpoint.

### When to use

Same circumstances as /v1/task/submit: a reprocess (Task.code reprocess, reasonCode claimrejected or partialpayment, workflow 18) after an adverse adjudication with new evidence, or a preauth cancellation (Task.code cancel with a cancellation reasonCode, workflow 122 or PC01). x-hcx-correlation_id carries the original claim or preauth correlation id. The specs do not say when the internal path applies; default to the public path unless onboarding guidance names this one.

### Preconditions

- As for the public endpoint: active provider with NPI facility code, Bearer token, payer certificate for JWE encryption.
- Body is a JWEPayload whose plaintext is the Task resource with basedOn referencing the original entity by the sender's reference id, Task.input with claimNumber and intimation number, and supporting evidence.
- Protected header with the original correlation id, fresh api_call_id, IST timestamp, workflow id and status request.initiated.
- Confirmation that the internal route is intended for your integration.

### Postconditions

Returns 202 Accepted with StatusSuccessResponse (entity_type task), or 400, 404 or 500 in the same envelope. The payer answers later on the task on_submit callback with a Task bundle wrapping a ClaimResponse: workflows 251 received, 252 approved, 253 rejected, 254 queried, PC02 cancellation accomplished. The decision is final within the workflow context. No additional behaviour is documented for the internal variant.

### Common mistakes

- Expecting the internal path to skip validation of basedOn, correlation id or status; it is documented as identical.
- Omitting Task.basedOn or minting a fresh correlation id.
- Cancelling a preauth not in submitted or approved state (PAYR-1252, PAYR-1253, PAYR-1257, PAYR-1258).
- Hard-coding the internal prefix without confirming the route; a 404 may be a host or prefix mismatch.

### Best practices

- Reuse the public endpoint's Task builder; make only the path prefix configurable.
- Link to the original entity in both basedOn and Task.input; use Task.description with reasonCode other.
- Fresh api_call_id per call, IST timestamps, request.initiated on the outbound header.
- Persist correlation id and workflow id for matching the callback; implement v1/error.

### Related scenario

A hospital integrator generating a client from the taskhcxservice Swagger sees hcxTaskPost and hcxTaskPostInternal with the same description. The team builds one reprocess-and-cancel module that posts to /v1/task/submit by default and can be switched to the internal path if NHCX onboarding requires it. When a surgeon changes the treatment plan after a preauth was approved, the module sends Task.code cancel with reasonCode treatmentplanchanged under the preauth's correlation id, receives 202, and later gets the cancellation confirmation on the task on_submit callback before a new preauth is raised.
