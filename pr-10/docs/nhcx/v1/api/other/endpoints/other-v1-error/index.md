# Error report (callback)

`POST /v1/error`

Where the exchange tells a sender that a request could not be delivered after five attempts. Received by every participant under its registered address. There is no outbound form.

### Business purpose

When the exchange cannot deliver a request, it tries five times, retires the correlation ID and tells the original sender here. A system without this endpoint never learns that its request died, and a dead request looks exactly like a case still under review. Every participant must host it.

### When to use

Hosted, never called. Implement it before anything else that is asynchronous. Providers and payers both host it.

### Preconditions

- Your callback address is registered: a domain name over HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or newer, hosted in India, reachable from the exchange's outbound addresses and answering within 30 seconds.
- The handler accepts a body it does not recognise. What arrives is a plain JSON report of the request the exchange gave up on, with the rejection details, not a sealed `JWEPayload`. Its field names are not published, so the body in this request is an illustration rather than a schema.

### Postconditions

Answer 202 with the receipt, like every other delivery, filling in whatever identifiers the report carries and leaving the rest empty. The original request is dead: its correlation ID has been retired, so a retry needs a fresh one.

### Common mistakes

- Not hosting it, so failed deliveries are never seen.
- Parsing the report against a fixed schema and answering `4xx` when it does not match.
- Retrying the failed request on the retired correlation ID.

### Best practices

- Store the report whole before doing anything with it.
- Mark the case it names as undelivered, so the desk does not wait for a decision that will not come.
- Check it first when a case goes quiet, before asking the exchange with `/v1/status`.

### Related scenario

A hospital posts a pre-authorisation and gets its receipt, but the payer's endpoint is down. The exchange tries five times, retires the correlation ID and posts a report to the hospital's `/v1/error`. The handler stores the report whole, answers 202 with the receipt, and marks the pre-authorisation undelivered. The desk resubmits it with a fresh correlation ID once the payer is reachable.
