# Status callback

`POST /v1/on_status`

The answer to a status request, delivered to the sender that asked. The `x-hcx-status` in the protected header says where the message you asked about got to. The payload is an empty string.

### Business purpose

It separates "did my message arrive" from "what did the payer decide". A sender learns whether a quiet case is still held by the exchange, has reached the recipient, or is dead, without resubmitting it and creating a duplicate.

### When to use

Hosted by every participant that sends `/v1/status`. It arrives in answer to a status request you sent.

### Preconditions

- You sent `/v1/status` with `x-hcx-correlation_id` set to the `api_call_id` of the message you were asking about, and you kept that mapping.
- Your callback address is registered and answers 202 within 30 seconds.

### Postconditions

Read `x-hcx-status` from the protected header. `request.dispatched` means the message reached the recipient, and `request.queued` that the exchange still holds it. `request.stopped` means redelivery was exhausted and the correlation ID retired, so the original request is dead and a retry needs a fresh correlation ID. `x-hcx-error_details`, with `code`, `message` and `trace`, is present where the original failed. Answer 202 with the receipt.

### Common mistakes

- Expecting a bundle. The payload is an empty string and everything travels in the header.
- Matching the answer on the original request's correlation ID. It carries the correlation of your status request.
- Retrying a `request.stopped` message on its old correlation ID.
- Offering a refresh or chase control in the user interface with no status exchange behind it.

### Best practices

- Keep every `api_call_id` you send. Without it you cannot ask the question at all.
- Act on `request.stopped` at once, and treat `request.dispatched` as a reason to wait for the payer.
- Ask from a support screen when a case has gone quiet for longer than the payer's expected turnaround, not on a timer.

### Related scenario

A pre-authorisation has had no answer for longer than the payer's usual turnaround. The support screen sends `/v1/status` with that request's `api_call_id` as the correlation ID. The answer arrives here with an empty payload and `x-hcx-status` `request.stopped`, so the desk knows the request is dead rather than slow, and resubmits it with a fresh correlation ID.
