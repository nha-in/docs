# Validate participant update

`GET /update/validate`

Confirms a participant update by presenting the SMS passcode and the transactionId returned by /v2/participant/update.

### Business purpose

Changing a participant's encryption certificate or callback endpoint changes where encrypted claims data is delivered and who can decrypt it, so the registry does not apply such updates on an API call alone. /v2/participant/update stages the change and sends a passcode to the registered mobile number; this call confirms it. It is step 4 of the production onboarding sequence and the same approval mechanism protects every later certificate or bridge rotation done through the v2 update.

### When to use

Call it after /v2/participant/update returns a transactionid and the passcode arrives by SMS, within the 24-hour validity window. The production URL is https://apisprod.nha.gov.in/pmjay/hcx/participanthcxservice/update/validate?transactionId=""&passcode="". It is also the closing step of the annual key-rotation checklist when rotation is done via /v2/participant/update. The passcode-free alternative for certificate-only changes is /v2/update/cert. No workflow or x-hcx-status codes apply.

### Preconditions

- The participant is already registered and its creation was confirmed via /validate.
- A completed /v2/participant/update that returned a transactionid, with the matching passcode received on the registered mobile number.
- The call is made within 24 hours; each new update trigger generates a new transaction id and passcode.
- Bearer token with the Bearer prefix in bearer_auth and Accept: application/json; parameters go in the query string.

### Postconditions

HTTP 200 with a bare string body (operation particiapntUpdateValidate, response type string). The staged certificate and endpoint URL become the participant's live registry values, which is what counterparties will receive from /fetch/certs and what the gateway will use for callback delivery. There is no asynchronous callback. Errors return the registry ErrorResponse envelope with 400, 404 or 500.

### Common mistakes

- Assuming the update is live as soon as /v2/participant/update returns; until this call succeeds counterparties may still fetch the old certificate.
- Presenting a passcode from a previous update attempt after a new one was triggered.
- Letting the 24-hour window lapse and then retrying validation instead of re-issuing the update.
- Calling /validate (creation) instead of /update/validate.
- Losing the transaction id, which requires repeating the update request.

### Best practices

- Rotate keys in two phases: keep the old private key available for decrypting inbound callbacks until the update is validated and cached certificates (24-hour TTL on the payer side) have refreshed.
- Persist transactionid with its 24-hour expiry and record who completed validation, for audit.
- Never log the passcode; treat it as a one-time credential.
- After success, call /participant/search on your own code to confirm encryption_cert and endpoint_url reflect the change.

### Related scenario

A year after go-live a payer's security team rotates the encryption key pair. The integrator generates a new self-signed X.509 certificate, Base64-encodes it and calls /v2/participant/update with participantcode and encryptioncert. The registry returns status and a new transactionid and sends a passcode to the registered mobile. Within the hour the team calls GET /update/validate with both values; on 200 the new certificate is live. Providers that cached the old certificate pick up the new one at their next 24-hour refresh, and the payer keeps the old private key for one more day to decrypt in-flight callbacks.
