## Rules

### 1. One structure per benefit

Everything about a benefit, its conditions and required documents, hangs off `coverage[].benefit[]`, with its money cap in `limit[]`. `plan[].specificCost[]` carries the cost per benefit category.

### 2. Conditions are prose

The `Claim-Condition` extension on a benefit carries a sentence, such as a window after discharge, with the number in `limit[]` as a value, a comparator and a unit.

### 3. Benefit types are the insurer's vocabulary

No closed value set is published for indemnity benefit types. Ask the insurer for its list before building a picker.

### 4. Requirements by stage

Supporting-info requirements name the stage they apply to, preauthorisation, discharge or claim, in the extension url.

### 5. Exclusions

Waiting periods, pre-existing-condition rules and excluded procedures are `Claim-Exclusion` extensions on the plan, each with a category and a statement.

### 6. What the screen caps

The amount, against the benefit's limit. Submission is blocked by an amount over the limit or a missing mandatory document.

## PMJAY
