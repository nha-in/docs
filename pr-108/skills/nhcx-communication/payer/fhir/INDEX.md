# FHIR

The FHIR resources this payer reads from a hospital's bundles and builds for its answers. APIs (A) and callbacks (C) refer to these by F number. Each file has RESOURCE (R), DESCRIPTION (D), FIELDS (F) and USED BY (U) sections. Direction is from this payer's side: `received` is read out of a hospital's bundle, `sent` is built by this payer, `both` is read and built.

Received resources are parsed as plain maps and never fail on a shape they merely do not know: a reference that resolves to nothing leaves its field blank, a resource with nothing usable is dropped, and the whole bundle is kept on the exchange log so it can be read again later. Sent resources follow the scheme's wire shape [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers): a collection bundle identified by the hospital's claim number, every resource tagged `SUBSETTED`, resolvable `https` fullUrls under this payer's base, and the Patient, both Organizations and the Coverage beside the focal resource.
