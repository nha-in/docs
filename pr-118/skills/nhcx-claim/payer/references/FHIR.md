# FHIR

Every FHIR resource the application builds for NHCX or reads from a hospital's message, in one list. Each row links to its full spec in [../fhir/](../fhir/INDEX.md). Sent profiles are the NRCeS profiles under `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/`; received resources are read without checking a profile.

## Envelope
