# D2. practitioner

#### D2T. TABLE
One row is one doctor or staff member of the facility; primary key `id`; no parent table.

#### D2D. DESCRIPTION
The practitioner master. The claim flow reads it for the treating team: the consultant on the admission (D4. encounter (in nhcx-preauth) `practitioner_id`) becomes the treating doctor of the pre-authorisation, and each care-team member (D26. claim_care_team (in nhcx-preauth)) is sent as a Practitioner with `identifier_value` as the HPR id, `qualification_display` as the degree, and `specialty_code` / `specialty_display` as the specialty.

Lifecycle:
- Created by seeding and from the practitioner master screen (S16). Save refuses a blank `name` ("a practitioner needs a name") or a blank `identifier_value` ("a practitioner needs a registration or HPID number").
- The screen always writes `prefix = 'Dr'`, `qualification_code = 'BS'`, `qualification_system` = HL7 v2-0203, `identifier_system = 'https://doctor.abdm.gov.in'`, `role_code = '158965000'`, `role_display = 'Medical practitioner'` and `active = 1` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). `specialty_*` comes from the `service_type` kind and `department` from the `department` kind of D8. terminology (in nhcx-preauth).
- Updated by the same form (saving an edit also sets `active = 1`).
- Retired or reinstated by toggling `active` (`1` active, `0` retired). Never deleted, because the name is on encounters, prescriptions and reports. It is a master table and survives the "clear transactional data" reset.
- Only `active = 1` rows are accepted onto a pre-auth care team.

#### D2K. KEYS AND INDEXES
- Primary key `id` (integer).
- No foreign keys out.
- Referenced by D4. encounter (in nhcx-preauth) `practitioner_id` and D26. claim_care_team (in nhcx-preauth) `practitioner_id`, and by EMR tables outside this spec (prescriptions, procedures, notes, labs, invoices, appointments).
- No unique constraints or indexes beyond the primary key.
