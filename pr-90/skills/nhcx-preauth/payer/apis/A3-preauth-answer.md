# A3. Pre-auth Answer

#### A3E. ENDPOINT
In-process: `gateway.send("v1/preauth/on_submit", envelope)`, [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md), which encrypts it and posts it to NHCX for the hospital, on the thread the pre-authorisation arrived on: `POST {nhcx}/v1/preauth/on_submit`. No answer to it is awaited.

It answers [C4. Pre-auth Submit](../callbacks/C4-preauth-submit.md) in every send the hospital makes on that thread: the first pre-authorisation, an enhancement, a query resubmission. The hospital's desk takes it in as its pre-auth reply and reads the outcome and the claim-level adjudication reason together; every reply on the thread is applied, an acknowledgement leaves it waiting and a decision settles it. The same route also carries a predetermination quote, which is [A10. Predetermination Quote](A10-predetermination-quote.md).

#### A3D. DESCRIPTION
A pre-authorisation is answered **twice** on one correlation id, and never more than once with a decision.

**1. The acknowledgement**, sent by the application the moment [C4. Pre-auth Submit](../callbacks/C4-preauth-submit.md) has filed the case: a ClaimResponse with `outcome` `queued`, adjudication `submitted`, disposition "Request acknowledged and accepted for further processing.", the case number as `preAuthRef` and the claim type on it. It decides nothing. It is sent because NHCX keeps a thread open only while it is being answered: a submission left silent is redelivered, then dropped and its correlation id retired, and the verdict a person takes hours over is refused with NHCX-1010 ("no data with given correlation id for call back request") [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The live PMJAY payer answers the same way [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). It is best effort: a case is filed whether or not it got out, and nothing is marked answered, so the verdict still goes.

**2. The verdict**, sent by [A13. Adjudicate](A13-adjudicate.md) when an adjudicator approves or rejects the case. It goes out once per thread: the transaction it went out under is kept on the case ([D19. case](../database/D19-case.md) `nhcx_answer_txn_id`), and a case whose thread is already answered is not answered again, because the hospital settles on the first decision and ignores a second. An enhancement reopens the thread ([C4. Pre-auth Submit](../callbacks/C4-preauth-submit.md) clears the answer transaction), so its decision goes out as a fresh verdict.

**A query is not a verdict.** When the adjudicator queries the case nothing goes on this thread: the question goes out as a CommunicationRequest on a thread of its own (A5. Query Request (in nhcx-communication/payer)), the submission stays open, and the ClaimResponse follows when the reply has been read and a decision made. (A scheme in `resubmit` query mode answers the query on this thread instead, `outcome` `partial` with reason `queried`, and takes the hospital's answer as a resubmission [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md).)

**3. A withdrawal.** When a cancel Task closes a case whose pre-authorisation was still unanswered ([C7. Task Submit](../callbacks/C7-task-submit.md)), the thread is closed with a ClaimResponse adjudicated `cancelled` under PC02, beside the Task's own answer ([A9. Task Answer](A9-task-answer.md)).

**What the verdict says** ([F9. ClaimResponse](../fhir/F9-claimresponse.md)), from the case ([D19. case](../database/D19-case.md)) and its lines ([D25. case_line_item](../database/D25-case-line-item.md)):

| Decision | `outcome` | Claim-level reason | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| approved in full | `complete` | `approved` | the adjudicator's remarks, else "Pre-authorisation approved for `<INR approved>`." |
| approved with cuts (`total_approved` < `total_claimed`) | `partial` | `approved` | the remarks, else "Pre-authorisation approved for `<INR approved>` of `<INR claimed>` claimed." |
| rejected | `error` | `rejected` | the remarks, else "Pre-authorisation rejected." |
| withdrawn | `error` | `cancelled` | "The pre-authorisation was withdrawn." |

Per line, four adjudications: `submitted` (claimed), `eligible` (approved), `reason` (the line's query remarks, else its remarks, else "Not payable under this policy." for a rejected line; the disposition when the line was allowed in full) and `status` (`Approved`, `Rejected`, `Queried`, `Requested`). Totals `benefit` and `eligible` are the approved total, `submitted` the claimed total. `preAuthRef` is the case number on every pre-authorisation answer, the refusal included [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Headers set by the application.**

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `x-hcx-sender_code` | This payer's participant code ([D1. payer](../database/D1-payer.md) `nhcx_participant_id`, else the configured code) |
| `x-hcx-recipient_code` | The case's `nhcx_sender_code`: the hospital that submitted |
| `x-hcx-correlation_id` | The case's `nhcx_correlation_id`: the pre-authorisation's thread |
| `x-hcx-workflow_id` | From the table below |
| `x-hcx-status` | `response.partial` on the acknowledgement, `response.complete` on a verdict |

Workflow ids, per scheme dialect (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers):

| Send | `pmjay` | `kyrocare` (Sandbox Payer) | `generic` | `x-hcx-status` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Acknowledgement | 20 | 20 | 20 | `response.partial` |
| Approved (no enhancement on the case) | 21 | 21 | 21 | `response.complete` |
| Rejected (no enhancement) | 23 | 23 | 23 | `response.complete` |
| Enhancement approved (the case has had an enhancement round) | 22 | 22 | 22 | `response.complete` |
| Enhancement denied | 231 | 231 | 231 | `response.complete` |
| Withdrawn | PC02 | PC02 | PC02 | `response.complete` |

The enhancement rows are chosen by the case's `enhancement_count` being above zero, not by which send the hospital made last [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). G7 completes the rest ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)).

**Checks before sending.** The case must have come off the exchange (`nhcx_correlation_id` set): a case raised on the desk itself has nobody to tell, and nothing is sent. A thread already answered is left alone. A gateway that is not configured is logged, "case `<id>` was decided but no gateway is configured, so `<hospital>` was not told", and the decision stands. Nothing refuses the adjudication: the decision is made and recorded before this send, and a gateway that cannot take it does not unmake it.

**Sandbox faults.** A case pinned to a FAULT scenario has its verdict broken on the way out (held, dropped, sent twice, malformed, on a stale thread, or saying the opposite) [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers); see [A19. Sandbox Scenarios](A19-sandbox-scenarios.md). Everything that happens is on the exchange log.

#### A3Q. REQUEST

The arguments passed to G7 Send:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jwe_headers` | object | The five headers above |
| `fhir` | Bundle | The ClaimResponse bundle |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md), [F9. ClaimResponse](../fhir/F9-claimresponse.md) (`use: preauthorization`), [F15. Patient](../fhir/F15-patient.md) (the member), [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md) (this payer and the hospital), [F18. Coverage](../fhir/F18-coverage.md) (the enrolment as Coverage)

Envelope, an approval:

```json
{
  "jwe_headers": {"x-hcx-sender_code": "<payer code>",
                  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<facility code>",
                  "x-hcx-correlation_id": "f8425e75-52e0-4413-a915-39a7bad38ee2",
                  "x-hcx-workflow_id": "21",
                  "x-hcx-status": "response.complete"},
  "fhir": <F1 Bundle: F9 ClaimResponse (use preauthorization, outcome complete, adjudication status approved, preAuthRef the case number, one item per line, totals), F15 Patient, F17 payer and provider Organizations, F18 Coverage>
}
```

The acknowledgement is the same bundle with `outcome` `queued`, reason `submitted`, workflow 20 and status `response.partial`.

#### A3S. RESPONSE

**Acknowledgement** (the G7 result): `{"ok": true, "gateway_status": 202, "txn_id", "correlation_id", "request_id", "headers", "response"}`.

Recorded, for the verdict:
- [D19. case](../database/D19-case.md) `nhcx_answer_txn_id` = the result's `txn_id`. This is the guard against a second verdict on the thread.
- [D27. case_exchange_message](../database/D27-case-exchange-message.md) one exchange message, direction `out`, kind `claimresponse`, the correlation id, the transaction, the hospital as counterparty, summary "Pre-auth verdict: `<status>`, `<INR approved>` approved of `<INR claimed>`", the bundle as payload.
- [D31. audit_log](../database/D31-audit-log.md) audit `preauth.answered` on the case: "`<hospital>` told, correlation `<id>`, answer txn `<txn_id>`".

For the acknowledgement: only the [D27. case_exchange_message](../database/D27-case-exchange-message.md) message, kind `claimresponse`, summary "Pre-auth verdict: acknowledged, with an adjudicator". `nhcx_answer_txn_id` stays empty.

**Failed send.** A G7 error or a result NHCX did not accept is logged ("could not queue the pre-auth verdict on case `<id>` for `<hospital>`: `<message>`") and nothing is recorded: `nhcx_answer_txn_id` stays empty, the case keeps its correlation id, and an operator can decide again (the same decision) to send it once more. The exchange log shows the decision without a transaction. A failed acknowledgement is logged and forgotten: the verdict is what counts.

Data: [D19. case](../database/D19-case.md), [D25. case_line_item](../database/D25-case-line-item.md), [D27. case_exchange_message](../database/D27-case-exchange-message.md), [D31. audit_log](../database/D31-audit-log.md), [D1. payer](../database/D1-payer.md), [D5. member](../database/D5-member.md), [D6. subscription](../database/D6-subscription.md), [D12. policy](../database/D12-policy.md)

Reply: none on this thread. What follows is the hospital's next message: an enhancement or a resubmission ([C4. Pre-auth Submit](../callbacks/C4-preauth-submit.md)), a cancel ([C7. Task Submit](../callbacks/C7-task-submit.md)), the claim (C5. Claim Submit (in nhcx-claim/payer)), a status enquiry ([C8. Status Enquiry](../callbacks/C8-status-enquiry.md)).
