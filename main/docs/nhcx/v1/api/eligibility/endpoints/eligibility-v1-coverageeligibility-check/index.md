# Submit the coverage eligibility check

`POST /v1/coverageeligibility/check`

Provider asks the payer, via NHCX, whether a beneficiary's policy is in force, what it covers and which documents a preauth will need.

### Business purpose

Coverage eligibility is the pre-check a hospital desk runs before committing a patient to a cashless pathway. It confirms three things the desk needs: that the policy is active, what benefits and wallet balance are available, and whether a specific procedure needs authorisation at all. A rejection that would otherwise surface days later at preauth or claim adjudication surfaces in seconds while the patient is still at the counter, which benefits the hospital (less rework), the payer (fewer malformed preauths) and the patient (earlier certainty).

### When to use

Call it at registration or admission, before /v1/preauth/submit. The CoverageEligibilityRequest.purpose field (1..*) decides what the payer computes: discovery is the fallback when /participant/get/policies does not yield a policy code; validation retrieves used amount, available balance and wallet liability; auth-requirements checks whether a chosen procedure is covered at this hospital and returns the STG questionnaires and MAND document codes the preauth must carry; benefits is also listed. Send x-hcx-status request.initiated. No eligibility-specific workflow code is published in the workflow tables; the workbook sample shows x-hcx-workflow_ID 11 (PATIENT_ADMITTED). For PMJAY an unspecified procedure still requires an auth-requirements check.

### Preconditions

- The provider is an onboarded NHCX participant (otherwise NHCX-1002) holding a valid Bearer token from the client-credentials session call; tokens expire after 1200 seconds.
- The payer's public certificate has been fetched via /fetch/certs (cache 24 hours) and the bundle is JWE-encrypted with RSA-OAEP-256 and A256GCM.
- x-hcx-recipient_code is the processingID from the get/policies response, not the PayerID.
- x-hcx-correlation_ID is a fresh UUID for this request cycle; x-hcx-API_call_ID is unique per call.
- The bundle contains the Patient (PMJAY Member ID and/or ABHA number), the Coverage record, both Organisations (provider and insurer) and a PractitionerRole for the enterer; items are included when purpose is auth-requirements.
- HTTP headers Accept: application/json, Content-Type: application/json and bearer_auth are all present.

### Postconditions

NHCX replies synchronously with HTTP 202 Accepted and a StatusSuccessResponse acknowledgement (TIMESTAMP, API_call_ID, correlation_ID, result with sender_code, recipient_code, entity_type coverageeligibility and protocol_status such as request.queued or request.dispatched, plus an empty error object). The 202 means only that the JWE structure and open protocol headers validated; the gateway then forwards the request to the payer asynchronously. The eligibility answer arrives later on the provider's /v1/coverageeligibility/on_check endpoint as a CoverageEligibilityResponseBundle, or as a ProtocolResponse carrying x-hcx-error_details, or as a redirect or forward instruction to try another payer. Other documented statuses are 400 request validation failed, 404 resource not found and 500 downstream systems down.

### Common mistakes

- Treating the 202 as the eligibility answer instead of waiting for the on_check callback; NHCX never returns a synchronous FHIR decision.
- Using the PayerID from get/policies as x-hcx-recipient_code instead of the processingID (NHCX-1003 receiver not registered).
- Reusing a correlation ID from an earlier cycle (NHCX-1006 duplicate request) or retrying a failed cycle under the same ID, which NHCX has already marked inactive.
- Sending the wrong status string; only request.initiated is accepted on an initiating request (NHCX-1011).
- Payer-side business rejections such as PAYR-1113 invalid item code, PAYR-1115 quantity not greater than 1, PAYR-1116 hospital not authorised for the policy, PAYR-1117 or PAYR-1122 no policy details, PAYR-1123 beneficiary not a covered member, and PAYR-1014 date of birth after date of service.
- Omitting the Accept header on the HTTP call.

### Best practices

- Persist the correlation ID against the patient episode before posting; it is the only key for matching the callback.
- Refresh the token automatically before the 1200-second expiry and treat a 401 as refresh-and-retry-once.
- Run discovery first only when get/policies gives no policy code, then validation, then auth-requirements for the chosen package; store the returned MAND codes and STG questionnaire references and attach them to the preauth.
- Do not assume the response echoes your request codes: items come back in the payer's numeric master codes (for example 100478 against your MG003B).
- Use IST timestamps with the +05:30 offset in the protected header.
- Log the 202 body (protocol_status, API_call_ID) so a missing callback can be traced with /v1/status.

### Related scenario

A patient arrives at a district hospital with a PMJAY card. The desk calls /participant/get/policies and receives a processingID for the state health agency. Because the treating doctor wants a corneal grafting package, the desk builds a CoverageEligibilityRequest with purpose validation and auth-requirements, encrypts it for the payer and posts it to /v1/coverageeligibility/check, receiving a 202 with protocol_status request.queued. Minutes later the payer's answer lands on /v1/coverageeligibility/on_check with inforce true, authorizationRequired true and MAND0409 and MAND0104 listed as supporting documents. The desk collects those documents and proceeds to /v1/preauth/submit under workflow 12.

}'
```

## Authorization

- `Authorization` (bearer token, required): On every NHCX call, the token goes in a header called `bearer_auth`, with the word `Bearer` and a space in front. The sources are not unanimous: the authentication page and the FAQ both write the example as `Authorization`, and the notification endpoint uses `Authorization`. The safe course, and what the adapter does, is to send both headers with the same value.

## Headers

- `bearer_auth` (string, required): It is `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`, on NHCX's own endpoints.
- `x-hcx-sender_code` (string, required): Your participant code. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-recipient_code` (string, required): The recipient's. For a provider, the processor code from the policy lookup. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-api_call_id` (string, required): Fresh on every message, including responses. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-request_id` (string): One per originating request. The Open Protocol page marks it Mandatory; the Technical Specifications page marks it Optional. Optional on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-correlation_id` (string, required): The thread. See the rule below. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-workflow_id` (string): Which step, or which case. See the two readings below. Optional on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-timestamp` (string, required): See the format note below. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-status` (string, required): Where this message stands. Values below. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-ben-abha-id` (string, required): The beneficiary's ABHA number. Mandatory on every exchange, including those with no beneficiary in the payload. Mandatory on the envelope.

## Body

- `payload` (string)

## Responses

- `202`: NHCX replies synchronously with HTTP 202 Accepted and a StatusSuccessResponse acknowledgement (timestamp, api_call_id, correlation_id, result with sender_code, recipient_code, entity_type coverageeligibility and protocol_status such as request.queued or request.dispatched, plus an empty error object).
