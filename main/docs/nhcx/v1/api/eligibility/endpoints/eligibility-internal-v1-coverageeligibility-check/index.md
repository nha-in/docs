# Submit the coverage eligibility check (internal) (adapter)

`POST /internal/v1/coverageeligibility/check`

Internal twin of /v1/coverageeligibility/check with the same JWEPayload body and response set; only the operationId differs.

### Business purpose

The coverage eligibility service publishes its check operation twice, once at /v1 and once at /internal/v1. Both let a provider validate a beneficiary's coverage with a payer before preauthorisation. The internal path exists in the OpenAPI document as an operationally distinct route for the same business function; the published material does not describe a separate business purpose for it.

### When to use

Documented as the internal variant of the eligibility check (operationId coverageeligibilityCheckPostInternal), served by coverageeligibilityhcxservice and tagged V1.0 APIs-Payer side like its public twin. The same purposes (discovery, validation, auth-requirements, benefits) and the same x-hcx-status request.initiated apply. The OpenAPI specs expose this operation twice, at /v1/... and at /internal/v1/..., with identical descriptions, request bodies and response sets; only the operationId differs (an Internal suffix). The specs do not document what makes the internal variant different beyond that suffix, so treat it as a mirror of the public path and integrate against the public /v1 path unless NHCX onboarding tells you otherwise.

### Preconditions

Identical to the public path: an onboarded provider with a valid Bearer token, the payer certificate fetched and cached, a CoverageEligibilityRequest bundle encrypted with RSA-OAEP-256 and A256GCM, a fresh correlation UUID, the processingID as recipient code, and the full x-hcx-* protected header set. Nothing additional is documented for the internal route.

### Postconditions

Same as /v1/coverageeligibility/check: HTTP 202 Accepted with a StatusSuccessResponse acknowledgement, then asynchronous forwarding to the payer and an answer on the on_check callback (the internal twin /internal/v1/coverageeligibility/on_check exists with the same body). 400, 404 and 500 carry the same schema.

### Common mistakes

- Assuming the internal path has different semantics or a different body; the specs give it the same JWEPayload body and the same responses.
- Integrating against the internal path without confirmation from NHCX onboarding, then hitting a 404 on the gateway host; when a path 404s, the endpoint index recommends trying the alternate host and prefix shape.
- All the mistakes listed for the public check (202 treated as an answer, wrong recipient code, reused correlation ID, wrong status string) apply unchanged.

### Best practices

- Default to /v1/coverageeligibility/check; use the internal path only where NHCX instructs you to.
- Keep one client implementation for both paths, parameterised only on the URL, so header hygiene and correlation handling stay identical.
- Log which variant was used with each correlation ID for troubleshooting.

### Related scenario

A hospital integration team exploring the coverageeligibilityhcxservice Swagger sees two check operations. They build one client against /v1/coverageeligibility/check and confirm with NHCX support whether the internal twin is meant for their deployment. In production traffic the eligibility request still starts from get/policies, goes out as a JWE to the check path, receives a 202, and the payer's answer arrives on the on_check callback before the preauth is raised.

### Specification

Chapter [Coverage eligibility request](/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/fhir/coverage-eligibility-request) of the NHCX integration specification.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/hcx/internal/v1/coverageeligibility/check \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSIONS_CALL>' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <access token>' \
  --header 'x-hcx-sender_code: 1000004446@hcx' \
  --header 'x-hcx-recipient_code: 1518@hcx' \
  --header 'x-hcx-api_call_id: <uuid>' \
  --header 'x-hcx-request_id: <uuid>' \
  --header 'x-hcx-correlation_id: <uuid>' \
  --header 'x-hcx-workflow_id: 11' \
  --header 'x-hcx-timestamp: <iso timestamp>' \
  --header 'x-hcx-status: request.initiated' \

}'
```

## Authorization

- `Authorization` (bearer token, required): On every NHCX call, the token goes in a header called `bearer_auth`, with the word `Bearer` and a space in front. The sources are not unanimous: the authentication page and the FAQ both write the example as `Authorization`, and the notification endpoint uses `Authorization`. The safe course, and what the adapter does, is to send both headers with the same value.

## Headers

- `bearer_auth` (string, required): It is `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`, on NHCX's own endpoints.
- `x-hcx-sender_code` (string, required): Your participant code. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-recipient_code` (string, required): The recipient's. For a provider, the processor code from the policy lookup. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-api_call_id` (string, required): Fresh on every message, including responses. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-request_id` (string): One per originating request. The Open Protocol page marks it Mandatory; the Technical Specifications page marks it Optional. Optional on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-correlation_id` (string, required): The thread. See the rule below. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-workflow_id` (string): Which step, or which case. See the two readings below. Optional on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-timestamp` (string, required): See the format note below. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-status` (string, required): Where this message stands. Values below. Mandatory on the envelope.
- `x-hcx-ben-abha-id` (string, required): The beneficiary's ABHA number. Mandatory on every exchange, including those with no beneficiary in the payload. Mandatory on the envelope.

## Body

- `payload` (string)

## Responses

- `202`: Same as /v1/coverageeligibility/check: HTTP 202 Accepted with a StatusSuccessResponse acknowledgement, then asynchronous forwarding to the payer and an answer on the on_check callback (the internal twin /internal/v1/coverageeligibility/on_check exists with the same body).
