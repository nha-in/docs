# Get the swagger UI configuration

`GET /swagger-resources/configuration/ui`

Returns the Swagger UI display configuration for the status service; consumed by Swagger UI, not by integrations.

### Business purpose

Swagger UI reads this endpoint to learn how the service wants its documentation rendered (for example, expansion and deep-linking settings). It supports the interactive exploration of the status service's /v1/status operation and has no role in claim settlement, routing or security. The endpoint index describes it as the Swagger UI configuration.

### When to use

Use it only in the context of a Swagger UI session against the status service; ordinary integrations never call it. The endpoint index lists it as endpoint 22. It is not part of any transaction workflow and does not appear in the sandbox exit checklists.

### Preconditions

- A GET request to the status service host; the OpenAPI documents in this corpus were captured from https://hcxsbx.ABDM.gov.in/<service>/api-docs, and the status service declares the server prefix /statushcxservice.
- No JWE envelope, no x-hcx-* protocol headers and no correlation ID; the docs do not state that a Bearer token is required for these discovery endpoints.
- No request body.

### Postconditions

The service returns HTTP 200 with a small JSON object of UI settings. Nothing changes on NHCX and no callback follows. The documentation does not enumerate the settings, so the example below is illustrative; read the live response if you need specific values.

### Common mistakes

- Pointing at the gateway base https://apisbx.ABDM.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx and expecting the per-service spec host; the docs advise swapping between the two URL shapes when a path 404s.
- Treating the served document as the integration contract for gateway traffic; the handbook's gateway base and header conventions take precedence where the two disagree.
- Sending a POST or a JSON body to a GET discovery endpoint.
- Wrapping the call in JWE or adding x-hcx-* headers, which only apply to protocol APIs such as /v1/status.

### Best practices

- Use these endpoints for exploration and client generation in the sandbox, and cache the document rather than fetching it on every run.
- Diff the served document against the corpus (Status service: OpenAPI 3.0.1, version 1.0.0) when behaviour changes unexpectedly.
- Never let production traffic depend on the availability of the documentation endpoints.
- Keep the /v1/status protocol rules in mind when reading the spec: x-hcx-correlation_ID must carry the original request's correlation ID.

### Related scenario

While preparing sandbox exit evidence, a payer's engineer captures screenshots of the status service's Swagger UI. The browser loads /swagger-resources/configuration/ui to decide how to render the page, then the resources list and the OpenAPI document. The engineer uses the rendered /v1/status operation to explain to the certification reviewer how the payer responds on the status callback when a provider asks about a dispatched preauthorisation.

### Specification

Chapter [Environments and addresses](/docs/nhcx/v1/reference/environments-and-addresses) of the NHCX integration specification.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/hcx/swagger-resources/configuration/ui \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSIONS_CALL>' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <access token>'
```

## Authorization

- `Authorization` (bearer token, required): On every NHCX call, the token goes in a header called `bearer_auth`, with the word `Bearer` and a space in front. The sources are not unanimous: the authentication page and the FAQ both write the example as `Authorization`, and the notification endpoint uses `Authorization`. The safe course, and what the adapter does, is to send both headers with the same value.

## Headers

- `bearer_auth` (string, required): It is `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`, on NHCX's own endpoints.

## Responses

- `200`: The service returns HTTP 200 with a small JSON object of UI settings.
