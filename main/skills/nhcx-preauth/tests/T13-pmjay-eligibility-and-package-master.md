# T13. PMJAY Eligibility, Package Master and Ruling

#### T13D. DESCRIPTION

The PMJAY start of a claim, as T3. IRDAI Policy Search and Eligibility (in nhcx-coverage) and [T4. IRDAI Insurance Plan and Authorisation Requirements](T4-irdai-plan-and-auth-requirements.md) are for IRDAI, under the `pmjay` adapter ([PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)): the policy search (A1. Policy Search (in nhcx-coverage)), eligibility ([A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md), C2. Coverage Eligibility Verdict (in nhcx-coverage)), the package master ([A3. Insurance Plan Request](../apis/A3-insurance-plan-request.md)) and the ruling on authorisation requirements ([A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md) `auth-requirements`, [C3. Authorisation Requirements Ruling](../callbacks/C3-auth-requirements-on-check.md)). PMJAY messages go to the policy's processing id (for PMJAY the state health agency), which the search returns; the payer id only chooses the adapter (CORE confusions).

**The package master is requested and then left alone.** PMJAY answers a plan request in 15 to 60 minutes, often about 30, and refuses a second request meanwhile (PAYR-1406) [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). So this test sends [A3. Insurance Plan Request](../apis/A3-insurance-plan-request.md) once, records the correlation id, and does not wait: it seeds a package master for the claim's policy and every PMJAY test runs on that. The seed is a few fixed packages that PMJAY approves at PPD-Trust without the plan being read back (fixed rates, no tiers, no implants, no documents beyond the ruling's), so a decision can be taken on them in [T14. PMJAY Pre-authorisation Through the Payer Service](T14-pmjay-preauth-adjudicated.md) to T18. PMJAY Payment Notice, Status Refusal and Cancel (in nhcx-payment). When the real plan does arrive on [C4. Insurance Plan Reply](../callbacks/C4-insuranceplan-on-request.md), it replaces the seed for that claim and the tests from then on use it.

#### T13S. SETUP

- The PMJAY test payer and the member id asked from the integrator ([T1. Test Configuration](T1-test-configuration.md)); `blocked` without it. The ABHA number is not needed: the registry returns it with the policy.
- A patient in the HMIS carrying that member id.
- The seed below, committed as `tests/nhcx/e2e/fixtures/pmjay-plan.json` (`NHCX_TEST_PMJAY_PLAN_SEED`). It is written exactly as given, not adapted: every code, name, price, flag, document and questionnaire is taken verbatim from PMJAY's own InsurancePlan answer for policy `PMJAY/HP/S/G` (the knowledge source's `fhir/C4/C4-response-pmjay.json`), cut down to two packages. Two is the most it holds, and which two is fixed:

| Package | Why it is in the seed |
|---|---|
| `SB043F` Hand (Single Stage Amputation), ₹18,600, surgical | The pre-authorisation and claim of [T14. PMJAY Pre-authorisation Through the Payer Service](T14-pmjay-preauth-adjudicated.md), [T15. PMJAY Query Answered by Resubmission](T15-pmjay-query-by-resubmission.md), T17. PMJAY Claim Through the Role Walk (in nhcx-claim) and T18. PMJAY Payment Notice, Status Refusal and Cancel (in nhcx-payment): a fixed rate, no tiers, no implants, approval not required, one per episode. Enhancement is not allowed on it. |
| `MG072C` Acute Haemodialysis, ₹1,500 a cycle, medical, day care | The enhancement of [T16. PMJAY Rejection and Enhancement](T16-pmjay-rejection-and-enhancement.md): enhancement is allowed, and it is cyclic (up to 6 cycles), so the enhancement is one more cycle of it. |

How the seed is used:

- It is written into the claim's [D10. claim_plan](../database/D10-claim-plan.md) (status `ready`, its source marked as the test seed) and [D11. claim_plan_benefit](../database/D11-claim-plan-benefit.md) rows, and the questionnaires into [D12. claim_plan_form](../database/D12-claim-plan-form.md), through the same code path [C4. Insurance Plan Reply](../callbacks/C4-insuranceplan-on-request.md) uses, so the screens and services see an ordinary plan. Never written where a real plan is already `ready`; removed when the run ends.
- The pre-authorisation of [T14. PMJAY Pre-authorisation Through the Payer Service](T14-pmjay-preauth-adjudicated.md), [T15. PMJAY Query Answered by Resubmission](T15-pmjay-query-by-resubmission.md), T17. PMJAY Claim Through the Role Walk (in nhcx-claim) and T18. PMJAY Payment Notice, Status Refusal and Cancel (in nhcx-payment) quotes `SB043F` once, ₹18,600. The claim of T17. PMJAY Claim Through the Role Walk (in nhcx-claim) bills the same.
- The enhancement of [T16. PMJAY Rejection and Enhancement](T16-pmjay-rejection-and-enhancement.md) is on a claim that quoted `MG072C`: one cycle at pre-authorisation, and the enhancement adds a second cycle (₹1,500), which the package allows (cyclic, up to 6). `SB043F` is never enhanced: PMJAY does not allow it.
- Documents: the tests attach one small PDF under each document code the chosen package lists, at the `pre` stage, before sending ([S9. Pre-authorisation](../screens/S9-preauthorisation.md)). The `Discharge Information` questionnaire and its attachments belong to the claim stage (S11. Claim Submission (in nhcx-claim)); the other four are answered at pre-authorisation, the required items with the options given, the rest with plain values.

#### T13G. GUI

1. [S5. Claim Master](../screens/S5-claim-master.md), S1. Search Policy (in nhcx-coverage), S2. Select Policy (in nhcx-coverage): new claim, search by the PMJAY member id, pick the PMJAY policy.
2. S3. Policy Discovery (in nhcx-coverage): discovery, then validation.
3. [S7. Insurance Plan](../screens/S7-insurance-plan.md): request the package master once; read "fetching" and move on. Seed the package master (payer driver, [T2. Test Runners](T2-test-runners.md)); reload [S7. Insurance Plan](../screens/S7-insurance-plan.md) and read it as `ready`.
4. [S8. Line Items](../screens/S8-line-items.md): add `SB043F` from the seed; [S8.2](../screens/S8-line-items.md): validate.

#### T13L. CLI

1. A1. Policy Search (in nhcx-coverage) with the member id; pick the PMJAY row; read the ABHA number the registry returned.
2. [A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md) `discovery` and `validation`; wait for C2. Coverage Eligibility Verdict (in nhcx-coverage) each.
3. [A3. Insurance Plan Request](../apis/A3-insurance-plan-request.md) once; record the correlation id; do not wait. Seed the package master for the claim's policy.
4. Add a line for `SB043F`; [A2. Coverage Eligibility Check](../apis/A2-coverage-eligibility-check.md) `auth-requirements`; wait for [C3. Authorisation Requirements Ruling](../callbacks/C3-auth-requirements-on-check.md).

#### T13X. EXPECT

- The search returns the PMJAY policy with both ids and the beneficiary's ABHA number, and every message is addressed to the processing id (read off the opened claim, as T3. IRDAI Policy Search and Eligibility (in nhcx-coverage) does).
- Both eligibility checks are answered; every claim line carries the programme code `AB-PMJAY` ([PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) and PMJAY's own code system; the facility is named by the HFR id on its own record.
- The plan request went out (NHCX 202) exactly once for this policy in the run; its correlation id is in the report. Its answer is not waited for. If it arrives, [S7. Insurance Plan](../screens/S7-insurance-plan.md) shows the real plan in place of the seed.
- The seeded package master reads `ready` on [S7. Insurance Plan](../screens/S7-insurance-plan.md) with exactly the two packages, their rates and documents as given, and the four pre-authorisation questionnaires; [S8. Line Items](../screens/S8-line-items.md) lists both packages.
- The ruling arrives on the auth-requirements correlation id and lists what the chosen package needs at the `pre` stage.
