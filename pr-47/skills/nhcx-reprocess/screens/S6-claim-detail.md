# S6. Claim Detail Screen

#### S6R. ROUTE
claims/view/:caseid (opens the Eligibility tab)
claims/view/:caseid/<tab key> (opens that tab; `?tab=<tab key>` is accepted as an alias)

Page title: Claim <case number>

Breadcrumb: Claims (claims/list, S5) > <case number>

Companion endpoint: claims/view/:caseid/state (GET, JSON).

#### S6D. DESCRIPTION
The shell for one claim case. It carries a header that says whose case it is and where it stands, a row of next-action buttons that say what the case is waiting for, and a tab bar that walks the episode in the order it happens. Every tab's content is rendered with the page; switching tabs happens in the browser without a reload. An unknown case id shows the standard "Claim" not-found page.

**Polling on load.** NHCX answers every leg asynchronously. The payer's reply normally arrives by callback ([G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) hands it to C1), and each load of this screen is the fallback: before anything is drawn, it reads [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md) once for every leg that is still out with the payer.

| Leg (tab) | Polled while | Poll failure shows |
|---|---|---|
| Eligibility check (S3) | case status `checking` | muted note "Could not poll the gateway: <error>" on the Eligibility tab |
| Insurance plan fetch (S7) | plan status `fetching` | muted note "Could not poll the gateway: <error>" on the Insurance plan tab |
| Auth-requirements ruling (Validate) | ruling status `checking` | nothing; the card keeps saying it is awaiting |
| Claim submission (S11) | submission status `submitting` | nothing |
| Predetermination quote (S9) | any quote status `asking` | nothing |
| Pre-authorisation (S9) | status `submitting` (polls the reply) or `cancelling` (polls the cancellation) | nothing |
| Status enquiries (S9, S11) | any enquiry status `asking` | nothing |

The page never reloads itself, because that would throw away whatever is being typed on another tab. The operator presses Refresh instead.

**Header.** On the left, the beneficiary name as the heading (the member ID when there is no name yet). On the right, a wrapping row of chips:

1. The case number, info tone.
2. The stage chip "<Stage>: <Sub-stage>" (values and tones in S5). The stage is recomputed on each load.
3. When the payer has messages on the case whose status is not `answered`: "1 query awaiting reply" or "<n> queries awaiting reply", warning tone.
4. When money has settled: "Paid ₹<total>", success tone (thousands separators, no decimals).
5. When any leg is still out with the payer (the same conditions as the poll table): a "Refresh" button with a refresh icon. It reloads this screen on the tab named in the current URL, which runs the polls again.

**Next actions.** Below the header, when the case is waiting on the desk, a muted "Next:" label and small buttons. The first button is primary, the rest secondary. Each one opens this screen on the tab where that action lives. They are worked out from the stage and sub-stage, so only a legal action is offered:

| When | Button label | Opens tab |
|---|---|---|
| Any payer query unanswered or whose reply failed (always first) | Answer the payer (<n>) | Communication (S10) |
| Stage `eligibility`, status `draft`, `error` or `not-eligible` | Check the cover | Eligibility (S3) |
| Stage `eligibility`, eligible, no ready plan | Fetch the package master | Insurance plan (S7) |
| Stage `eligibility`, plan ready, no line items | Quote the treatment | Line items (S8) |
| Stage `eligibility`, line items present | Send the pre-authorisation | Pre-authorisation (S9) |
| Stage `preauth`/`enhancement`, `queried` | Answer the query (payer that takes answers by resubmission) | Pre-authorisation (S9) |
| | Answer the payer's query (payer that takes a Communication, when no query is already listed first) | Communication (S10) |
| Stage `preauth`/`enhancement`, `draft` or `refused` | Send the pre-authorisation | Pre-authorisation (S9) |
| Stage `preauth`/`enhancement`, `rejected` | Send a fresh pre-authorisation | Pre-authorisation (S9) |
| Stage `preauth`/`enhancement`, `approved`/`partial`, lines added since | Send the enhancement (<n> added) | Pre-authorisation (S9) |
| Same, nothing added, no discharge recorded | Record the discharge | Claim (S11) |
| Same, discharge recorded | File the claim | Claim (S11) |
| Stage `preauth`/`enhancement`, `requested`/`answered`/`resubmitted` | With the payer; ask where it stands | Pre-authorisation (S9) |
| Stage `claim`, `queried` | Answer the claim query (resubmission payer), else "Answer the payer's query" | Claim (S11) / Communication (S10) |
| Stage `claim`, `rejected` or `partial` | Ask for a reprocess | Claim (S11) |
| Stage `claim`, `requested`/`answered`/`resubmitted` | With the payer; ask where it stands | Claim (S11) |
| Stage `claim`, `refused`, another send allowed | Send the claim again | Claim (S11) |
| Stage `claim`, `refused`, no send left | Ask for a reprocess | Claim (S11) |
| Stage `claim`, any other sub-stage (approved) | Await the payment notice | Payments (S12) |
| Stage `payment`, a notice not yet acknowledged (or its acknowledgement failed) | Acknowledge the payment notice | Payments (S12) |
| Stage `payment`, all acknowledged | Settled | Payments (S12) |

**Tabs**, in this order. The tab key is the `tab` query value:

| # | Key | Label | Screen |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `eligibility` | Eligibility | S3 |
| 2 | `plan` | Insurance plan | S7 |
| 3 | `lines` | Line items | S8 |
| 4 | `validate` | Validate | S8.2 (auth-requirements ruling on the line items) |
| 5 | `preauth` | Pre-authorisation | S4 (link admission, draft form) and S9 (send, verdict, documents, forms) |
| 6 | `communication` | Communication | S10 |
| 7 | `claim` | Claim | S11 |
| 8 | `payments` | Payments | S12 |

Tab rules:
- No `tab`, or an unknown key, opens Eligibility.
- Old key alias: `procedure` opens `plan` (the plan tab's name before line items had their own tab), so old bookmarks still land [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- The Pre-authorisation tab is designed to appear once the payer has ruled on the procedure set on Validate (at once for a payer that does not rule), and to stay once a pre-authorisation has been sent. In the current build it is always shown: one scheme's sandbox never answers the ruling [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers), so the tab does not wait, and a ruling that arrives later narrows the documents and forms it asks for. If the tab is hidden and `preauth` is asked for, Validate opens instead.
- The Validate tab reads "Choose the line items on the previous tab first..." until line items exist. After that it holds the ruling card and a card saying the Pre-authorisation tab is open, with a primary "Go to the pre-authorisation" button (arrow icon) to S9.

- The heading and the chip row sit on one line and wrap on narrow screens; chips wrap among themselves.
- The Refresh button sits among the chips and appears only while something is awaiting the payer.
- The "Next:" row appears only when there is at least one action. Its buttons are small; the first is primary.
- The tab bar underlines the active tab. Panes below are stacks of cards with a consistent vertical gap.
