# Read Sets

What to read before implementing one spec, so a task never needs the whole skill. Each row is one screen, API, callback or gateway part, and the FHIR, database and gateway specs it links to, followed through their own links (tables and hub specs such as the bundle envelope F1 and the claim table D9 are listed but not followed further). Only specs this skill holds are listed.

Always read, whatever the task: [CORE.md](CORE.md) (addresses and the exchange table), [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) (every bundle), [D9. claim](../database/D9-claim.md) (every case), [C1. Callback Door](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md) (every reply), and the knowledge source ([KNOWLEDGE.md](KNOWLEDGE.md)).
