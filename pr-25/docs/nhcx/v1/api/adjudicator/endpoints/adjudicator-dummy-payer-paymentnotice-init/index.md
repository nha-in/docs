# Submit the dummy payer, send a payment notice

`POST /paymentNotice/init`

Makes the sandbox dummy payer send a payment notice to the provider named, on `/v1/paymentnotice/request`.

### Business purpose

A payment notice only follows a settled claim, which is slow to reach in a test. This hook makes the sandbox's dummy payer, `1000003538@hcx`, send one on demand, so a provider can build and test its payment notice handling and acknowledgement without waiting for a settlement.

### When to use

Sandbox testing of the payment notice flow, once your `/v1/paymentnotice/request` callback is in place. The body names your participant code in `providerId`. It also carries a `claimNumber` field, left empty in this collection, whose effect the documentation does not describe.

### Preconditions

- Your participant is registered on the sandbox with a reachable callback address.
- You host `/v1/paymentnotice/request` and answer it 202 within 30 seconds.
- An ordinary ABDM session token.

### Postconditions

The dummy payer sends a payment notice to the provider named, arriving on `/v1/paymentnotice/request`. The provider acknowledges it on `/v1/paymentnotice/on_request`.

### Common mistakes

- Triggering the notice before the `/v1/paymentnotice/request` handler is in place.
- Sending another participant's code in `providerId`.
- Receiving the notice and never sending the acknowledgement on `/v1/paymentnotice/on_request`.

### Best practices

- Test both the receipt and the acknowledgement.
- Keep this hook out of production code paths. It exists only in the sandbox.

### Related scenario

A provider has built its payment notice handler. It posts this hook with its own participant code in `providerId`. A payment notice from the dummy payer arrives on its `/v1/paymentnotice/request`. The handler answers 202, opens and records the notice, and sends the acknowledgement on `/v1/paymentnotice/on_request`.

### Specification

Chapter [NHCX Use Cases](/docs/nhcx/v1/concepts/nhcx-use-cases) of the NHCX integration specification.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/dummyhcxpayer/paymentNotice/init \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_SESSIONS_CALL>' \
  --header 'bearer_auth: Bearer <access token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "providerId": "<participant code>",
  "claimNumber": ""
}'
```

## Authorization

- `Authorization` (bearer token, required): On every NHCX call, the token goes in a header called `bearer_auth`, with the word `Bearer` and a space in front. The sources are not unanimous: the authentication page and the FAQ both write the example as `Authorization`, and the notification endpoint uses `Authorization`. The safe course, and what the adapter does, is to send both headers with the same value.

## Headers

- `bearer_auth` (string, required): It is `bearer_auth`, not `Authorization`, on NHCX's own endpoints.

## Body

- `providerId` (string)
- `claimNumber` (string)

## Responses

- `200`: The dummy payer sends a payment notice to the provider named, arriving on `/v1/paymentnotice/request`.
