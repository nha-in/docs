# Database

The tables behind the desk, registry, configuration and payment screens. Screens (S), APIs (A) and callbacks (C) refer to these by D number. Each file has TABLE (T), DESCRIPTION (D), COLUMNS (C), KEYS AND INDEXES (K) and USED BY (U) sections.

D1 to D18 are tables most payer systems already have: the insurer's own record, staff and roles, the document taxonomy, members, enrolments and their wallets, products and the procedures they cover. They are extended only where NHCX needs a column (the participant codes on the payer, the ABHA number and link state on an enrolment, the package rate, treatment-guideline questions and per-phase document rules on a procedure, the SNOMED clauses and exclusions the InsurancePlan is rendered from). D19 to D32 are new for the exchange: the case and its children, the messages and deliveries, the quotes, the payments and the numbering.

Table names are written without the reference implementation's `payer_` prefix [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Primary keys are the business identifiers the desk reads out (a case id, a claim number, a payment number), allocated from [D32. id_sequence](D32-id-sequence.md) so the prefix and width are decided in one place [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Child rows that are never quoted (line items, documents, timeline entries) take short random ids [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). Money is a fixed-point decimal with two places; timestamps carry a time zone and are stored in UTC.
