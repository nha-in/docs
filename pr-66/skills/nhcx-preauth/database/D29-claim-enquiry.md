# D29. claim_enquiry

#### D29T. TABLE
One row is one small Task exchange a claim starts beside its main legs: a status enquiry, a reprocess request or a balance release request. Primary key `id`. Parent table: `claim` (D9), many rows per claim.

#### D29D. DESCRIPTION
Each ask is its own Task on `task/submit` with its own correlation id, so each is its own row.

**Created.** One row per ask, inserted with `status` `asking`, `kind`, `stage`, `txn_id`, `correlation_id`, `requested_at`, `reason` and `request_json`. When [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md) reports the send failed after naming its ids, the row is inserted with `status` `error` and the message. The three kinds:

| kind | Where | Allowed when | stage | Workflow id | Extra columns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | S9 (pre-authorisation card) or S11 (claim card) | the leg has been sent (D18 exists; D20 not `draft`) and the payer's adapter answers status enquiries [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | `preauth` or `claim` | the leg's own `correlation_id`, else `13` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | none |
| `reprocess` | S11 | D20 is `rejected`, `partial` or `approved` and the claim is not paid in full (D21 paid total below D20 `requested_amount`) | `claim` | adapter's `reprocess` (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | `reason` (required text), `reason_code`, `document_ids` |
| `release` | S11 | D20 is `approved` or `partial` and not paid in full; the amount must be above 0 | `claim` | adapter's `release` (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | `reason` (the optional note) |

`reason_code` must be one the adapter allows: `claimrejected` (the default), `partialpayment`, `rejectiondisputed` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The reprocess Task carries the chosen D28 documents; `document_ids` records their ids. `reason_code` and `document_ids` are written by an update right after the insert.

**Statuses** (exact strings): `asking`, `answered`, `error`.

- `asking` to `answered`: a Task reply arrives on the thread, by callback C8 (a `status` or `task` message on a correlation id held here is routed here before anything else) or by polling when the claim is opened. It writes `answered_at`, `response_json`, `answer`, `detail`, and clears `error_message`.
  - `status`: `answer` is `entity_status` from the `x-hcx-status_response` header, else the Task's `claimStatus` output, else `not-found` when the Task is `rejected`, else `unknown`. `detail` is the Task description plus the header's `stage`, `outcome`, `total_approved` and `total_paid`.
  - `reprocess` and `release`: `answer` is `reopened` when the Task status is `completed`, `accepted` or `in-progress`, otherwise `refused`; `detail` is the reply's disposition or the Task description. When reopened, the claim leg (D20) goes back to `submitting` to wait for the new verdict on its own thread.
- `asking` to `error`: a ProtocolResponse on the thread, a peer, protocol or own dispatch error found by polling, or a ledger 404 (the message tells the desk to ask again).
- `error` to `asking` to `answered`: an `error` row is revived when the payer answers on its thread anyway.
- An `answered` row ignores further replies.

`amount` exists in the schema but no code path writes it; the release amount travels only in `request_json`.

**Deleted.** Never by the application; by cascade with the claim or when the transactional store is cleared.

#### D29K. KEYS AND INDEXES
- Primary key `id` (integer).
- Foreign key `claim_id` references `claim (id)` (D9), `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- Index `ix_claim_enquiry_corr` on `(correlation_id)`.
- Index `ix_claim_enquiry_claim` on `(claim_id, id)`; asks are listed newest first, filtered by `kind` and `stage`.
