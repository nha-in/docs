# Core

The NHCX facts every task needs, on one page: the addresses per environment, the calls that are not exchanges, and for each exchange the route, the bundle sent, the workflow id it travels under, the callback that answers it and the bundle that comes back. The knowledge source ([KNOWLEDGE.md](KNOWLEDGE.md)) is the authority behind every value here (`baseurl.yaml`, `workflow.yaml` and `usecases.yaml` in the package; `search_docs` and `get_operation` on the MCP). Check a value there before relying on it, and when they differ, the knowledge source wins.

NHA use-case codes are written `nha:B3`; bare ids (A4, C5, F8) are this skill's specs.

## Instructions

Follow these strictly, in every step and every file. When a spec seems to say otherwise, stop and resolve it against this list and the knowledge source; record the resolution under `corrections` in the current plan file.

1. **The gateway is inside the application.** Call it as functions ([G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md) `gateway.send`, [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md) `ledger.*`, [G10. Beneficiary Registry](../gateway/G10-beneficiary-registry.md), [G3. Session Token](../gateway/G3-session-token.md)). Never call a separate gateway service over HTTP, and never mount any gateway route except the inbound route and the health checks ([G1. Embedding](../gateway/G1-embedding.md)).
2. **NHCX facts come from the knowledge source, never from memory.** Paths, headers, profiles, codes and workflow ids are checked there ([KNOWLEDGE.md](KNOWLEDGE.md)). On the protocol it wins over every spec; on what the application does, the specs win.
3. **Nothing payer- or environment-specific is hard-coded.** Participant codes, base URLs, workflow ids and scheme rules come from configuration or the payer adapter ([PAYERS.md](PAYERS.md)). Production URLs are set explicitly.
4. **One way out, one way in.** Every message leaves through `gateway.send`. Every message arrives through [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) and `C1.receive(envelope, delivery)`, which routes it to one callback. A reply found by polling (A10 to A13) is applied by that same callback handler, never by separate code.
5. **Replies are matched by `x-hcx-correlation_id`** (a payment notice by the claim number it carries), never by workflow id, route or timing.
6. **Every callback is safe to receive twice.** It answers `settled`, `unmatched`, `ignored` or `rejected` (NHCX gets 202, no redelivery) or `error` (NHCX gets 502 and redelivers). Only an unexpected fault is `error`.
7. **A failed send that names its ids keeps them.** Store the ids from the send result on the leg and mark it failed; the message may still have reached NHCX.
8. **Keep the layers.** Screens call services and read models. Only services (A) and callbacks (C) write claim tables. FHIR builders and parsers never touch the database or the gateway ([SCAFFOLDING.md](SCAFFOLDING.md)).
9. **No secrets in the repository.** Client secret, private key and payer desk credentials come from configuration or the environment.
10. **Treat markers as defined.** [REF](PAYERS.md#markers) may be chosen differently (record it); [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers) values come from the payer adapter; [SANDBOX](PAYERS.md#markers) behaviour is not relied on in production.
11. **Work the steps in order and log them.** L1 to L8, one plan file each, every sub-step and file change in `nhcx-plan/progress.json` ([LOG.md](../steps/LOG.md)). Re-read this page at the start of each step.

## Confusions

Terms and behaviours that are easy to mix up, with the reading this skill uses.

| Easily confused | Correct reading |
|---|---|
| This skill's ids and NHA's use-case codes | `A1` is our policy search; `nha:A1` is NHA's participant list. `C5` is our pre-auth reply callback; `nha:C5` is NHA's "respond to pre-authorisation" (a payer use case). Always prefix NHA codes with `nha:`. |
| "Gateway" | Here, the in-process module G. NHA's documents also call the NHCX exchange itself "the gateway", and ABDM has its own session gateway. Write "the exchange" for NHCX and "sessions" for ABDM. |
| Workflow id, correlation id, api call id, request id, ledger id | Workflow id (`x-hcx-workflow_id`): which step of the claim flow this is. Correlation id: the thread, kept by every reply. API call id: one message, kept across NHCX's redeliveries (the dedupe key). Request id: one request. Ledger id (`txn_id`): our own record in [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md), never sent to NHCX. |
| Payer id and processing id | The policy search returns both. The **processing id** is the participant that handles the policy on NHCX (for PMJAY, the state health agency) and is the recipient of every message; the **payer id** only chooses the payer adapter. They are often equal in the sandbox, which hides the mistake. |
| `x-hcx-status` on a query answer | A query answer goes on a request route (`.../submit`) but is a response: `response.complete`, not `request.initiated`. |
| Our workflow ids and the payer's | The table in section 4 is what we send. The payer's replies carry their own (PMJAY: 20, 21, 25, 26 and others [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers)); nothing routes on them. |
| An id we pass and the id that goes out | Correlation, request and api call ids that are not plain UUIDs are silently replaced when sending ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)). Store the ids from the send result, never the ones passed in. |
| NHCX's 202 on a send | The exchange accepted the message for delivery. It says nothing about the payer's decision, which arrives later on the callback. |
| `outcome: complete` in a ClaimResponse | Not an approval: it comes back for a rejection too [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers). The decision is read from the adjudication (F9. ClaimResponse (in nhcx-preauth)). |
| Request and `on_` routes for payer-started exchanges | For payment notices and payer communications the payer calls `.../request` and we answer on `.../on_request`, the opposite way round from every exchange we start. |
| Two coverage replies on one route | The eligibility verdict (C2. Coverage Eligibility Verdict (in nhcx-coverage)) and the authorisation-requirements ruling (C3. Authorisation Requirements Ruling (in nhcx-preauth)) both arrive on `v1/coverageeligibility/on_check`; the correlation id decides which. Likewise `v1/task/on_submit` carries the cancel answer (C7. Cancel Reply (in nhcx-preauth)) and enquiry answers ([C8. Enquiry Reply](../callbacks/C8-enquiry-on-submit.md)). |
| A `ProtocolResponse` | A refusal of our message by NHCX or the payer, not an answer to it. It arrives in place of a bundle, on the same thread. |
| The redelivery flag | A hint, not a reason to skip: a first delivery that failed is also on the ledger. Handlers dedupe by the api call id stored on the leg. |
| Query mode | PMJAY asks inside its ClaimResponse and takes the answer as a fresh submit (A4. Pre-auth Submit (in nhcx-preauth), A5. Claim Submit (in nhcx-claim)); other payers ask with a CommunicationRequest and take a Communication (C9. Payer Communication (in nhcx-communication), A7. Communication Reply (in nhcx-communication)) [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers). A CommunicationRequest from PMJAY is a notification. |
| Claim number, claim reference, pre-auth reference | The claim number is our case number, sent as `Claim.identifier` (`claim_ref` keeps the one a leg went under). The pre-auth reference (`preAuthRef`) is the payer's number for its approval. |
| Member id, policy code, product id | The member id identifies the beneficiary on the policy. The policy code identifies the policy or plan; some registries return only a product id, used as the policy code then [REF](PAYERS.md#markers). |
| ABHA number and ABHA address | The 14-digit number (what links a claim to an admission) and the `name@abdm` style address; they are different fields ([D3. patient](../database/D3-patient.md)). |
| HFR id and participant code | The HFR id identifies the facility in the health facility registry (the provider Organization's identifier, [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md)); the participant code (`...@hcx`) is its address on NHCX. |
| Sandbox participant codes | Examples only ([PAYERS.md](PAYERS.md)). Every code comes from configuration. |
| Predetermination and status routes | NHA lists `v1/predetermination/submit` and `v1/status`; the reference implementation sends predetermination on the pre-auth route and status as a Task [REF](PAYERS.md#markers). Check which the payer accepts. |
| Step ids, section letters, log ids | `L1` to `L8` are steps; `S1L` is the LAYOUT section of S1; `LOG-0042` is a progress log entry; `X1` to `X10` are the end-to-end exchanges of L8. |
| A9 | There is no A9: the inbound door it once described became the callbacks, C1 to C10. |

## 1. Environments and base URLs

| Service | Used for | Sandbox | Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| ABDM sessions | the session token every call carries ([G3](../gateway/G3-session-token.md)), `POST /api/hiecm/gateway/v3/sessions` | `https://dev.abdm.gov.in` | `https://apis.abdm.gov.in` (published by ABDM; confirm in the onboarding letter) |
| NHCX exchange | every exchange, under `/v1` ([G7](../gateway/G7-send.md)) | `https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/hcx` | shared by NHA after sandbox exit |
| Participant service (registry) | participant records, certificates, policies ([G4](../gateway/G4-registry.md), [G10](../gateway/G10-beneficiary-registry.md)) | `https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in/pmjay/sbxhcx/participanthcxservice` | `https://apisprod.nha.gov.in/pmjay/hcx/participanthcxservice` |
| PMJAY payer service, role lookup | sandbox adjudication (A14 (in nhcx-preauth)) [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers) | `https://apisbx.abdm.gov.in` + `/pmjay/sbxhcx/nhcxpayerservice/v1/get/user-role` | not published |
| PMJAY payer service, act on a case | sandbox adjudication (A15 (in nhcx-preauth)) [PAYER](PAYERS.md#markers) | `https://apisbeta.nha.gov.in` + `/pmjay/hcx/nhcxpayerservice/wrapper/process/case` | not published |
| NHCX portal | the portal and its published API specifications | `https://hcxsbx.abdm.gov.in` | not published |

| Setting | Sandbox | Production |
|---|---|---|
| `X-CM-ID` on the session call | `sbx` | `abdm` |
| This application's inbound route | the public URL registered as the participant's `endpoint_url`, routed to `/in/<path>` or `/v1/<path>` ([G8](../gateway/G8-receive.md)) | the same, on HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or newer), a domain name hosted in India, no IP address and no port; NHCX's source addresses allowed in ([OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md)) |

The gateway's built-in production defaults ([G2. Configuration and Participants](../gateway/G2-configuration.md)) follow a host-swap guess (`apisbx` to `apis`, `dev` to `live`) that does not match the published production participant service or sessions host above. Set every production URL explicitly in configuration.

## 2. Calls that are not exchanges

Plain JSON with the session token: no JWE, no protocol headers, no ledger row.

| NHA use case | Call | Does | This skill |
|---|---|---|---|
| nha:A4 | sessions (above) | trade client id and secret for the session token | [G3](../gateway/G3-session-token.md) |
| nha:A3 | registry `/fetch/certs` | a participant's encryption certificate | [G4](../gateway/G4-registry.md) |
| nha:A1 | registry `/fetch/participants/list`, `/participant/search` | participant records | [G4](../gateway/G4-registry.md) |
| nha:A2 | registry `/participant/get/policies` | a beneficiary's policies by member id, mobile or ABHA number | A1 (in nhcx-coverage), [G10](../gateway/G10-beneficiary-registry.md) |
| nha:C1, nha:C2 | registry `/participant/link/abha/policy`, `/participant/delink/abha/policy` | link or unlink an ABHA number and a policy | [G10](../gateway/G10-beneficiary-registry.md) |

## 3. Protocol defaults

- Every exchange is one FHIR Bundle ([F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md)) encrypted as a compact JWE to the recipient's certificate ([G6. Encryption](../gateway/G6-encryption.md)), with the `x-hcx-*` headers in the protected header ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)).
- `x-hcx-status`: `request.initiated` on a request we start, `response.complete` on an `on_` path **and on a query answer** (workflow 19, 131, 151, 161), even though a query answer goes on `v1/preauth/submit` or `v1/claim/submit`. The sending API sets it; the gateway's path default is only a fallback ([G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md), [PAYERS.md](PAYERS.md)).
- `x-hcx-recipient_code`: the policy's **processing id** from the policy search, not its payer id (NHCX-1003 otherwise); the payer id only picks the payer adapter (A1. Policy Search (in nhcx-coverage), [D9. claim](../database/D9-claim.md)).
- A reply keeps the request's `x-hcx-correlation_id`; callbacks match on it ([C1. Callback Door](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md)).
- A refusal comes back as a plain `ProtocolResponse` instead of a bundle, on the same thread ([C1. Callback Door](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md), [A13. Transaction List](../apis/A13-txn-list.md)).
- Workflow ids below are the provider's sends. The payer's replies carry their own; callbacks never route on them.

## 4. Exchanges

"Workflow id" gives the `pmjay` value first and the `generic` value when it differs; [PAYERS.md](PAYERS.md) has every adapter. Every send is made through `gateway.send` ([G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md)); every reply is taken in by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md) and routed by [C1. Callback Door](../callbacks/C1-callback-door.md).
