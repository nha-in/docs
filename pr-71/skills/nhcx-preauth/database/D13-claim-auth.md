# D13. claim_auth

#### D13T. TABLE
One row is the payer's authorisation-requirements ruling on a claim's procedure set; primary key `id`; parent table [D9. claim](D9-claim.md) (one row per claim).

#### D13D. DESCRIPTION
After the lines are chosen, the procedure set is sent as a coverage eligibility check with purpose `auth-requirements` (A2, answered on C3). The check carries the same items the Claim will. The payer answers per line ([D14. claim_auth_item](D14-claim-auth-item.md)): is authorisation required, is the line excluded, what is allowed. It also names the documents and questionnaires the set needs ([D15. claim_auth_requirement](D15-claim-auth-requirement.md)). A `ready` ruling is the source of the required documents and forms for both legs. Without one, the package master ([D10](D10-claim-plan.md)) is used instead.

When it is sent:
- By hand from S8 ("Validate"). This needs `claim.status = 'eligible'` ("Check the policy's eligibility before validating a procedure set against it."). A failed send raises the error.
- Automatically before every pre-auth send (first request, enhancement, query answer). Skipped when the claim is not `eligible`, has no lines, or the payer adapter does not answer auth-requirements. Also skipped when a non-`error` ruling already exists for the same procedure set (`asked_codes` equal to the current set). A failed automatic send is swallowed, and the pre-auth goes out anyway.

Request:
- Written: `status = 'checking'`, `txn_id`, `correlation_id`, `requested_at` = now, `asked_codes` = the current procedure set. Nulled: `settled_at`, `error_message`, `outcome`, `disposition`, `inforce`, `response_json`. A failed send writes `status = 'error'` and `error_message`.
- The first request inserts the row. A later one deletes its items and requirements and updates the row, in one transaction.

Reply (C3 callback, or polling by `txn_id`):
- The last CoverageEligibilityResponse in the bundle is the payer's. Written: `outcome`, `disposition`, `inforce` (from `insurance[0].inforce`), `status = 'ready'`, `settled_at` = now, `error_message` = null, `response_json`. Items and requirements are deleted and re-inserted in the same transaction.
- `status = 'error'` with `error_message` on a ProtocolResponse, a protocol error in the ledger, a dispatch status of `dispatch_failed`, `dead` or `failed`, or a ledger 404 ("... Check again.").
- A coverage reply whose correlation id matches no claim's eligibility check ([D9](D9-claim.md)) is matched here by `correlation_id`.
- A redelivery for a row no longer `checking` is ignored unless the last send is on record as failed; then it is revived to `checking` and applied.

A `ready` ruling is stale when the quoted non-Stratification line codes differ from the ruled item codes. Any change to the procedure set (codes, quantities or tiers) makes `asked_codes` differ, so the ruling is asked again at the next pre-auth send.

Status values and transitions:
- (none) -> `checking` or `error`.
- `checking` -> `ready` or `error`.
- `ready`, `error` -> `checking` on a new request.

Delete: never directly. The row goes with its claim (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) or with the "clear transactional data" reset.
