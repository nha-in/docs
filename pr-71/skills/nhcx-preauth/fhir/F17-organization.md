# F17. Organization

#### F17R. RESOURCE
- `resourceType`: `Organization`
- Profile in `meta.profile`: `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Organization`
- Direction: **sent**, as the provider (the facility) and the payer, in every outbound bundle except the InsurancePlan request (F4). **Received** in almost every payer bundle; read only to find which Organization is the facility's when a communication is answered.

#### F17D. DESCRIPTION
Two roles, one builder:

| Role | fullUrl | `type` | Identifier type | Identifier value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Provider | `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/provider` | `prov` "Healthcare Provider" | `NPI` "National provider identifier" | the facility's HFR id |
| Payer | `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/payer` | `pay` "Payer" | `NIIP` "National Insurance Payor Identifier (Payor)" | the payer's participant code without its `@` suffix (`<code>@hcx` goes as `<code>`) |

Both identifiers carry `system` `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in` (not the facility's own identifier system on D1). The provider is always first, the payer second.

**Where they come from.**
- Provider: the default facility (`D1 organization` with `is_default`). Every send refuses without its HFR id and participant code ("Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings ...").
- Payer: the claim's payer (`D9 claim.payer_id`, `D9 claim.payer_name`), else the configured default payer code and name (the reference implementation defaults to the PMJAY payer, see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). `D9 claim.payer_name` is set when the claim is opened: the name the policy search returned, else the payer adapter's name (for example `PMJAY / Ayushman Bharat`).
- Exception: when a notification is acknowledged and the payer named no Organization as the facility's, the payer Organization built there takes its code from the notification's `x-hcx-sender_code` (F12).

**`id` by bundle.**

| Bundle | Provider `id` | Payer `id` |
|---|---|---|
| Claim bundles (F8, A4 and A5), communication-reply stubs (F12) | `1` | `2` |
| Eligibility (F2), Task bundles (F10, F14) | none | none |
| Communication reply lifted from a sent leg, acknowledgement | as the source bundle had them | as the source bundle had them |

**Received Organizations.** Not read in eligibility, ClaimResponse, InsurancePlan, Task or payment bundles. In a CommunicationRequest bundle (F11) they are used only when the answer is built (F12):
- acknowledgement: the facility's is the one the payer's `Task.owner` or `CommunicationRequest.recipient[]` points at (by fullUrl), else the one whose `type` has a coding `prov`, else none (the facility's own is built);
- reply lifted from a sent leg: the provider is the one typed `prov`, else the one at the provider fullUrl, else the first; the payer is the next.

Payers type themselves differently: PMJAY `pay`, the Sandbox Payer `ins` "Insurance Company" with ROHINI and PRN identifiers [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
