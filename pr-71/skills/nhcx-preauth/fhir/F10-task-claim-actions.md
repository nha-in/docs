# F10. Task (claim actions)

#### F10R. RESOURCE
`Task`, profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/Task`, the anchor of a bundle with profile `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/StructureDefinition/TaskBundle` (F1). Direction: sent (cancel, status, reprocess, release) and received (the payer's Task reply on `task/on_submit`, which carries no profile).

#### F10D. DESCRIPTION
Every follow-up on an existing case that is not a Claim goes as a Task asking the payer to do something with that case. Four kinds are sent:

| Kind | Asks | Leg | Anchor (`entry[0].fullUrl`) | Bundle `id` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cancel | withdraw the pre-authorisation | pre-authorisation | `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/preauth/cancel` | `preauth-cancel-request-generic` |
| status | where does the leg stand | pre-authorisation or claim | `.../preauth/status` or `.../claim/status` | `preauth-status-request-generic` or `claim-status-request-generic` |
| reprocess | look at a decided claim again, with evidence | claim | `.../claim/reprocess` | `claim-reprocess-request-generic` |
| release | pay the unpaid balance of a partly paid claim | claim | `.../claim/release` | `claim-release-request-generic` |

**Bundle entries**, in order: the Task at the anchor, then the provider Organization at `https://nhcx.abdm.gov.in/provider` and the payer Organization at `.../payer` (F17). No resource in a Task bundle carries an `id`. There is no Patient: the beneficiary is named on a reprocess Task's `for` only.

**Common to every kind:** `status` `requested`, `intent` `order`, `code` on `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/financialtaskcode` with **no display**, `authoredOn` now, `requester` the provider, `owner` the payer. Inputs are typed on `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/CodeSystem/ndhm-task-input-type-code` and carry a `valueString`, except the release amount. Reasons are on `https://nrces.in/ndhm/fhir/r4/CodeSystem/ndhm-reason-code`. "The claim number" is the number the leg went out under (D18 or D20 `claim_ref`), else the current D9 `claim.claim_no`.

Rules:
- The input is spelled `intimationNumber`. PMJAY refuses a reprocess carrying the misspelt `initimationNumber` with PAYR-1008 [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- A cancel with reason `other` needs a note: it is the only thing the payer can read.
- A status Task is not in the NHCX reference bundles. It is the same shape on `/<leg>/status`, sent on the task route because the NHCX sandbox refuses `v1/status` (A6) [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).
- The payment acknowledgement is also a Task on the same pattern (code `status`, status `completed`); it is specified in F14.
- A reprocess or release names the claim twice: on `basedOn` (a `CLN` identifier) and as the `claimNumber` input.

**The payer's reply** is a Task bundle: the payer's Task, and usually a ClaimResponse that the Task's `output[].valueReference` points at, resolved inside the same bundle by `fullUrl` (or by resource `id` after any `urn:uuid:` prefix) and read as F9. The reply's own `code` (for example `approve` on `http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/task-code`), `requester`, `owner` and anchors are not read.

| Reply to | Accepted when | Then |
|---|---|---|
| cancel (C7) | Task `status` is absent, `completed` or `accepted`, and the ClaimResponse `outcome` is not `error` | pre-authorisation `cancelled`; the claim number is retired and the case continues under a new number |
| cancel (C7), otherwise | | pre-authorisation back to `approved` with "The payer did not accept the cancellation." |
| status (C8) | always answered (a payer may refuse the enquiry instead; PMJAY does, see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) | the entity status is taken from the envelope header `x-hcx-status_response.entity_status`, else the Task output coded `claimStatus` (`valueString`), else `not-found` when the Task `status` is `rejected`, else `unknown` |
| reprocess, release (C8) | Task `status` is `completed`, `accepted` or `in-progress` | `reopened`: the claim leg goes back to `submitting` and the new verdict arrives on the claim's own thread (F9) |
| reprocess, release (C8), otherwise | | `refused` |

When several Task replies are on a cancel thread (two payer copies can answer one Task [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)), any acceptance wins over refusals, and for 15 minutes after a refusal the thread is still watched for a late acceptance [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

Cancel reasons (`reasonCode`):

| Code | Display |
|---|---|
| `treatmentplanchanged` | Treatment plan changed during hospitalization |
| `patientrequest` | Patient requested cancellation |
| `financialconstraints` | Financial constraints |
| `alternativetreatment` | Alternative treatment chosen |
| `duplicateclaim` | Duplicate claim / preauth |
| `administrativeerror` | Administrative error |
| `other` | Other reason |

Reprocess reasons (`reasonCode`; the adapter decides which it allows, see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers):

| Code | Display |
|---|---|
| `claimrejected` | Reprocess request due to claim rejected by payer |
| `partialpayment` | Reprocess request due to partial payment by payer |
| `rejectiondisputed` | Rejection disputed, additional evidence provided |

A reprocess with no description of its own defaults to "Reprocess the claim `<claim number>`" (or "Please cancel the preauth for claim `<claim number>`" with reason `partialpayment`, a quirk kept as is [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)), but the application always requires the reason text, so the default is not reached from the screens.

Received Task reply, elements read:

| Element read | Stored in | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Task.status` | cancel: decides accepted (above); reprocess / release: D29 `claim_enquiry.answer` `reopened` or `refused` | |
| `Task.output[].valueReference.reference` | resolves the ClaimResponse in the bundle | read as F9 |
| ClaimResponse `outcome`, `disposition` (F9) | cancel: D18 `claim_preauth.outcome`, `.disposition`; reprocess / release: D29 `detail` = the disposition, else the Task `description` | an `outcome` of `error` refuses a cancel |
| `Task.output[]` with `type.coding[0].code` `claimStatus`, `valueString` | status: D29 `answer`, when the header gives none | |
| `Task.description` | status: D29 `detail` (first part) | |
| envelope `x-hcx-status_response` (object, or a string holding JSON): `entity_status`, `stage`, `outcome`, `total_approved`, `total_paid` | status: D29 `answer` = `entity_status`; `detail` adds "stage: ...; outcome: ...; total_approved: ...; total_paid: ..." joined with "; " | not FHIR, a protocol header |
| the whole bundle | D18 `response_json` (cancel), D29 `response_json` (others) | D29 `status` `answered`, `answered_at` |
