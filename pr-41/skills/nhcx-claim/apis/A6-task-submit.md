# A6. Task Submit (cancel, status, reprocess, release)

#### A6E. ENDPOINT
In-process: `gateway.send("v1/task/submit", envelope)`, [G7. Send](../gateway/G7-send.md), which encrypts it and posts it to NHCX for the payer: `POST {nhcx}/v1/task/submit`. The payer answers with a Task bundle on `task/on_submit` (taken in by [G8. Receive](../gateway/G8-receive.md), callbacks C7 and C8 through the callback door C1, type `task` or `status`, or found by polling the [G9. Ledger](../gateway/G9-ledger.md), A10 / A11 / A12 / A13).

#### A6D. DESCRIPTION
Every follow-up request that is not a Claim goes on this route as a Task bundle. Four kinds:

| Kind | What it asks | Leg |
|---|---|---|
| cancel | Withdraw the pre-authorisation | pre-auth |
| status | Where does this leg stand? | pre-auth or claim |
| reprocess | Look at a decided claim again | claim |
| release | Pay the unpaid balance of a partly paid claim | claim |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md) (the bundle id and Task anchor of each kind), [F10. Task (claim actions)](../fhir/F10-task-claim-actions.md)

The status Task goes on `task/submit`, not on the NHCX status route, because the NHCX sandbox refuses `v1/status` with NHCX-1012 whatever correlation id it carries [SANDBOX](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Workflow ids (`x-hcx-workflow_id`).** From the payer adapter (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

| Kind | `pmjay` | `xyz` (Sandbox Payer) | `generic` |
|---|---|---|---|
| cancel | PC01 | PC01 | PC01 |
| status | the leg's correlation id, else `13` [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) | same | same |
| reprocess | 36 | 36 | 36 |
| release | 36 | 36 | 36 |

Cancel, reprocess and release are read from the adapter and can be overridden per environment (a JSON object of kind to workflow id), for example to send cancel as `122`, which one NHA source gives in place of PC01. The status Task's workflow id is not read from the adapter [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers).

**Headers set by the application** (G7 generates the rest, [G5. Protocol Headers](../gateway/G5-protocol-headers.md)): `x-hcx-sender_code` = facility participant code; `x-hcx-recipient_code` = the case's processing id (D9 `processing_id`), else the case's processing id, else the claim's payer id, else the configured default payer code; `x-hcx-workflow_id` as above.

**Status enquiry and the adapter.** PMJAY answers no status Task (it refuses it with PAYR-1018 without a reason code and PAYR-1008 with one) [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers) (see [PAYERS.md](../references/PAYERS.md)), so its adapter turns the enquiry off and a request is refused before sending: "`<adapter name>` answers no status enquiry over NHCX; read where the case stands on its own desk, and the verdict arrives on this thread." The Sandbox Payer and Generic adapters allow it.

**Checks before sending.**

| Kind | Errors, in order |
|---|---|
| cancel | "There is no pre-authorisation to cancel."; "A pre-authorisation that is `<status label, lower case>` cannot be cancelled." (only `submitting`, `approved`, `partial`, `queried` can be); "Choose why the pre-authorisation is being cancelled."; with reason `other` and no note: "Describe the reason, with “Other reason” the note is the only thing the payer can read."; "Set the facility's HFR ID and NHCX participant code under Settings first." |
| status | "Ask about the pre-authorisation or the claim."; the adapter refusal above; "No pre-authorisation has been sent yet." (pre-auth) or "The claim has not been submitted yet." (claim); the Settings error |
| reprocess | "Only a claim the payer has decided can be sent back for reprocessing." (claim must be `rejected`, `partial` or `approved`); "A claim that has been paid in full cannot be reprocessed."; "Say why the claim should be looked at again."; the Settings error; "Choose why the claim is being sent back." (a reason code the adapter does not allow); "That document is not on this claim." |
| release | "Only a decided claim can have its balance asked for." (`approved` or `partial`); "A claim that has been paid in full has no balance."; "Say how much of the claim is still owed." (blank, zero or negative); the Settings error |

"Paid in full" means the paid total from payment notices (A8) is at least the claimed amount.

**Cancel reasons:**

| Code | Display |
|---|---|
| `treatmentplanchanged` | Treatment plan changed during hospitalization |
| `patientrequest` | Patient requested cancellation |
| `financialconstraints` | Financial constraints |
| `alternativetreatment` | Alternative treatment chosen |
| `duplicateclaim` | Duplicate claim / preauth |
| `administrativeerror` | Administrative error |
| `other` | Other reason (the note is then required) |

**Reprocess reasons** (all three allowed by every adapter):

| Code | Display |
|---|---|
| `claimrejected` | Reprocess request due to claim rejected by payer |
| `partialpayment` | Reprocess request due to partial payment by payer |
| `rejectiondisputed` | Rejection disputed, additional evidence provided |

#### A6Q. REQUEST

The arguments passed to G7 Send:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jwe_headers` | object | The three headers above |
| `fhir` | Bundle | The Task, then the provider and payer Organizations |

FHIR: [F1. Bundle](../fhir/F1-bundle.md), [F10. Task (claim actions)](../fhir/F10-task-claim-actions.md), [F17. Organization](../fhir/F17-organization.md)

Envelope, cancel (PMJAY):

```json
{
  "jwe_headers": {"x-hcx-sender_code": "<facility code>",
                  "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<payer code>",
                  "x-hcx-workflow_id": "PC01"},
  "fhir": <F1 Bundle carrying F10 Task (code cancel, reason administrativeerror, claimNumber and intimationNumber NM-26-0SH000006), F17 provider and payer Organizations>
}
```

Envelope, status (Sandbox Payer; the workflow id is the pre-auth's correlation id):

```json
{"jwe_headers": {"x-hcx-sender_code": "<facility code>",
                 "x-hcx-recipient_code": "<payer code>",
                 "x-hcx-workflow_id": "623780ae-bf5e-4f47-82fc-790e1644a642"},
 "fhir": <F1 Bundle carrying F10 Task (code status, claimNumber NM-26-0SH00002B), F17 Organizations>}
```

A reprocess (PMJAY, workflow `36` [PAYER](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)) and a release carry their own F10 Task in the same envelope.

#### A6S. RESPONSE

**Acknowledgement:** the G7 result, `{"ok": true, "gateway_status": 202, "txn_id", "correlation_id", "request_id", "headers", "response", ...}`.
- Cancel: the pre-auth leg goes to `cancelling` under the cancel's own ids, with the reason and the note.
- Status, reprocess, release: an enquiry row in `asking` under its own ids.

**Failed send.** When the failure names ids: the cancel leaves the pre-auth in `error` with the message under the cancel ids; an enquiry row is stored as `error`. A payer answer that later arrives on those ids reopens the row and is applied.

Data: [D18. claim_preauth](../database/D18-claim-preauth.md), [D29. claim_enquiry](../database/D29-claim-enquiry.md)

Reply: C7. Cancel Reply (in nhcx-preauth) (cancel), [C8. Enquiry Reply](../callbacks/C8-enquiry-on-submit.md) (status, reprocess, release)

**Polling.**
- Cancel (while `cancelling`, or within 15 minutes of a refusal): A10 (G9 related) with `cancel_txn_id`; every entry not sent by this facility is fetched with A12, and every bundle carrying a Task is read; an acceptance is applied first, else the newest answer. With none, a ProtocolResponse found through A13 (type `task`) and A12 turns it to `error`. When G9 no longer holds it (A10 not found): "The gateway no longer has the cancel transaction, its ledger was reset after it was sent. Cancel again." (ignored during the grace period).
- Enquiries (while `asking`): A10, newest inbound Task via A12. With none: a refused payer answer when one G hosts both participants, a ProtocolResponse through A13 (type `task`), or the enquiry's own A11 status (`dispatch_failed`, shown as the ledger's `errorMessage` / `errorCode` / "Dispatch to NHCX failed.") makes it `error`. When G9 no longer holds it (A10 not found): "The gateway no longer has this transaction. Ask again."
