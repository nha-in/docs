# L7. Dry-run Tests

#### L7G. GOAL
Prove the code behaves as specified without touching NHCX or the ABDM registry. Everything outside the process is replaced: NHCX answers from a fake, the registry from fixtures, and inbound messages are fed straight to G8 and C1.

#### L7I. INPUTS
- `nhcx-plan/code.json`, `nhcx-plan/validation.json` (only validated files are tested).
- The test framework and command from discovery.json.

### L7.1 Set up the fakes
- A fake NHCX endpoint for G7 that records each request and answers 202, a non-2xx with an error body, or a transport failure, as the test asks.
- Registry fixtures for G4 (a participant record and certificate) and G10 (a policy search reply, and the "No policies found" error).
- A test key pair, so G6 encrypts and decrypts for real.
- A test database with the migrations applied.
- Received bundles taken from the knowledge source: `get_fhir_example` (MCP) or `nhcx-plan/knowledge/nhcx-package/fhir/` (package), copied into `tests/nhcx/fixtures/bundles/` with their source noted.

### L7.2 Test the FHIR mappers (F)
For each builder, build from fixture rows and check every FnF element and the F1 bundle order. Run the result through `validate_fhir` when the MCP is the source; otherwise compare it with the package's example bundle for the same exchange. For each parser, feed a bundle written from the FnF description and check the D columns it fills.

### L7.3 Test the APIs (A)
For each A, drive its pseudocode: every pre-send refusal (message verbatim), the successful send (the request G7 made, the D rows and statuses written), a send failure that names ids, and one that names none.

### L7.4 Test the callbacks (C)
For each C, hand an envelope to G8 (encrypted with the test key) or straight to C1, and check the result (`settled`, `unmatched`, `ignored`, `rejected`, `error`), the D changes, and the answer G8 gives. Include a redelivery and a `ProtocolResponse` for each.

### L7.5 Test the gateway (G)
Headers (G5), encryption round trip (G6), send result and error codes (G7), inbound refusal codes such as `WRONG_RECIPIENT` and `DECRYPT_FAILED` (G8), ledger queries and their order (G9).

### L7.6 Test the screens (S)
Render each screen with fixture data and check fields, options, columns, chips, empty states and validation messages; post each action and check where it leads.

### L7.7 Run the whole flow dry
One test walks a claim from S1 to S12 against the fakes: policy search, eligibility, plan, line items, pre-auth, a query and its reply, claim, payment and its acknowledgement.

#### L7O. OUTPUT
Test files in the target's test layout, and `nhcx-plan/dry-run.json`:

```json
{
  "command": "",
  "run_at": "<ISO time>",
  "tests": [
    {"file": "", "name": "", "covers": ["C5", "D18.status"], "result": "pass | fail | skip", "failure": ""}
  ],
  "coverage": {"S": [], "A": [], "C": [], "F": [], "D": [], "G": []},
  "summary": {"pass": 0, "fail": 0, "skip": 0},
  "corrections": []
}
```

#### L7L. LOG
Record in `nhcx-plan/progress.json` and regenerate `nhcx-plan/progress.md`, as [LOG.md](LOG.md) describes. One entry per sub-step, and one per test file created or modified, with the spec ids it covers. Each test run is logged with its pass, fail and skip counts, and every write to `nhcx-plan/dry-run.json`.

#### L7X. EXIT
- Every spec id in code.json `coverage` is covered by at least one passing test.
- The full dry flow (L7.7) passes.
- No test calls a real network address.
- Every sub-step of L7 has its `started` and closing entries in progress.json, and every file changed is named in one.
