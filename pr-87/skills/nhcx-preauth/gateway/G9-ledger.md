# G9. Ledger

#### G9E. ENTRY
In-process, the four reads the application polls with:

- `ledger.related(txn_id) -> [Row]` (A10)
- `ledger.fhir(txn_id) -> TxnEnvelope` (A12)
- `ledger.dispatch(txn_id) -> DispatchState` (A11)
- `ledger.list(limit = 200) -> [Row]` (A13)

And, for the gateway's own use and for diagnostics:

- `ledger.record(entry)` (G7, G8), `ledger.get(id)`, `ledger.thread(correlation_id)`, `ledger.seen(direction, api_call_id)`, `ledger.last_inbound_request(entity, from, workflow_id)`, `ledger.sweep(now)`

No network calls. Files only.

#### G9D. DESCRIPTION
The ledger is the gateway's record of every message it sent or received: headers, payload, and what became of it. It is plain files, no database [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). The application never writes to it; it reads it to find a reply by polling (A10 to A13) when the callback (C1) has not delivered one.

**The contract.** What the rest of the application relies on is this, not the storage:

- `record(entry)` for every message sent or received, with its headers, payload and outcome;
- `related(txn_id)`: every entry on the same correlation thread, newest first;
- `fhir(txn_id)`, `get(id)`: one entry's envelope, or the whole entry;
- `dispatch(txn_id)`: what became of one send;
- `list(...)`: entries newest first, for the rejection scan (A13);
- `seen(direction, api_call_id)`: whether a message was already recorded (the redelivery flag of G8);
- pruning by a retention period.

The storage described below (one file per message under dated folders, with in-memory indexes) is the reference implementation's [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). A target may keep the ledger in its own database instead, with the same contract; a ledger in the shared database can also be read by every instance ([OPERATIONS.md](../references/OPERATIONS.md)).

A transaction id is a ledger id. `send` (G7) returns it as both `ledger_id` and `txn_id`; the application stores it on the leg and polls with it.

Storage, under `ledger.dir` (default `data/ledger`, relative to the gateway config file):

```text
<dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<id>.json     one entry, pretty-printed JSON, file mode 0640
<dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/index.jsonl   one summary line per entry, appended as written
```

The day folder is the entry's `created_at` in UTC. At startup only the `index.jsonl` files are read, into memory: summaries by id, ids in ascending order, ids by correlation id, and a `seen` set of `<direction>:<api_call_id>`. A full entry (with headers and payload) is read from its file on `get`.

Ids are eight characters over the alphabet `0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV` (base 32 whose ASCII order is its numeric order, so ids sort by time as plain strings). The first four encode the UTC date as the number YYMMDD, the last four a counter that restarts each day at `0001` (up to 1,048,575 a day). `7UMV0001` is the first message of 2026-08-31. This id format is [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers). On the first message of a day, including the first after a restart, the counter continues from the highest id already on record for that date. Ids from older builds (24 or more characters starting `YYYYMMDD`) are still readable.

Retention: `ledger.retentionDays` (0 or unset keeps everything; the sample config sets 30 [REF](../references/PAYERS.md#markers)). Every hour, and once at start, day folders whose date is before `now - retentionDays` (UTC) are deleted with their entries, and dropped from the in-memory indexes (so their `api_call_id`s no longer count as seen). `ledger.storeBodies` (default true): when false, the payload and the peer's response body are not kept, so `fhir` reads back empty. `ledger.enabled` (default true): when false nothing is recorded, the reads below fail, redelivery is never flagged and responses are not threaded automatically (G7).

#### G9Q. INPUT
`Entry`, as written by G7 and G8 (missing `id`, `created_at`, `entity`, `action`, `kind` and `fhir_summary` are filled in by `record`):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | next id | ledger id, format above |
| `direction` | none | `out` (application to NHCX) or `in` (NHCX to application) |
| `created_at` | now | send start, or receipt time |
| `path` | none | NHCX path, slashes trimmed |
| `entity` | from path | `preauth`, `claim`, `coverageeligibility`, `insuranceplan`, `task`, `communication`, `payment`, `status`, ... (G5 entity type) |
| `action` | last path segment | `submit`, `on_submit`, `check`, `on_check`, `request`, `on_request`, ... |
| `kind` | from path | `response` when `action` starts `on_`, else `request` |
| `format` | none | `fhir`; inbound also `protocol`, `json`, or `unknown` for a refused message |
| `sender`, `recipient` | none | participant codes |
| `correlation_id`, `api_call_id`, `request_id`, `workflow_id` | none | from the protected headers |
| `hcx_status` | none | `x-hcx-status` |
| `status` | none | outcome, table in G9S |
| `error` | none | `{code, message}` when not a success |
| `redelivery` | false | inbound: an earlier inbound row had the same `api_call_id` |
| `duration_ms` | 0 | dispatch time (out) or delivery time (in) |
| `peer` | none | `{url, status_code, response}`: NHCX's answer (out) or C1's (in) |
| `headers` | none | the full protected header set |
| `fhir` | none | the payload |
| `fhir_summary` | computed | `{resource_type, bundle_type, entries, resource_types, focus, identifier, patient, outcome}` of the payload |

Query input: `txn_id` is a ledger id. `limit` for `list` is 1 to 500, default 200; an out-of-range value is ignored and the default used.

#### G9S. OUTPUT
Statuses:

| Status | Direction | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `accepted` | out | NHCX answered 2xx |
| `rejected` | out | NHCX answered non-2xx (error `GATEWAY_HTTP_<n>`) |
| `rejected` | in | the gateway refused it: undecryptable, wrong recipient, unreadable |
| `failed` | out | never reached NHCX (no certificate, no token, unreachable) |
| `delivered` | in | C1 took it |
| `delivery_failed` | in | C1 refused or failed; NHCX will redeliver |

`Row` (one element of `related` and `list`), newest first:

| Field | From |
|---|---|
| `id` | ledger id |
| `direction` | `in` or `out` |
| `status` | table above |
| `sender`, `recipient` | codes |
| `correlation_id`, `api_call_id` | ids |
| `type` | `entity`, protocol spelling (`coverageeligibility`, `insuranceplan`, `preauth`, `claim`, `task`, `payment`, ...) |
| `flow` | `action` (`on_submit`, `request`, ...) |
| `created_at` | RFC 3339 timestamp with fractional seconds and zone |

`related(txn_id)`: every row with the same correlation id as that entry, both directions, newest first, at most 500. The entry itself is included.

`fhir(txn_id)` returns `TxnEnvelope`, the same shape C1 receives, from the stored entry:

```json
{"meta": {"type": "out", "payloadType": "fhir", "path": "v1/preauth/submit", "time": "2026-09-21T12:01:05.123+05:30"},
 "jwe_headers": {"x-hcx-correlation_id": "...", "x-hcx-api_call_id": "...", "...": "..."},
 "fhir": {"resourceType": "Bundle", "...": "..."}}
```

`meta.type` is `in` or `out`; `meta.payloadType` is the entry's `format`. `fhir` is `null` when bodies are not stored or the message was refused before decryption. There is no `payload` key.

`dispatch(txn_id)` returns `DispatchState`:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `txnId` | the id |
| `status` | `dispatch_failed` for `failed` and `rejected`; `dispatched` for `accepted` and `delivered`; otherwise the ledger status as is (`delivery_failed`) |
| `errorCode` | `error.code` (for example `CERT_NOT_FOUND`, `GATEWAY_HTTP_400`), when set |
| `errorMessage` | `error.message`, when set |

There is no `dispatch` object and no `dead` or `errored` status: dispatch is synchronous (G7), so by the time a transaction has an id its fate is decided and there is nothing queued to retry. NHCX's own refusal body is on the full entry's `peer.response` (`ledger.get`), not in this answer.

`list(limit)`: the newest `limit` rows of the whole ledger, same `Row` shape. With the ledger off it returns `[]`.

Errors (`related`, `fhir`, `dispatch`):

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `NO_TXN_ID` | `txn_id` empty |
| `TXN_NOT_FOUND` | no entry with that id (unknown, pruned, or the ledger folder was reset). Final: A10 treats it as "stop polling" |
| `LEDGER_DISABLED` | the ledger is off |

`thread(correlation_id)`, for diagnostics: `{correlation_id, entity, workflow_id, counterparty, role, state, started, updated, messages: [Summary, oldest first]}` or nothing when unseen. `role` is `initiator` when the first message went out, `responder` when it came in (reversed when the first message is a response). `state` is derived by walking the messages oldest first:
- a `failed` or `rejected` message, a `delivery_failed` response, a `protocol` payload, or an `hcx_status` containing `error`: `error`;
- otherwise a request out: `awaiting_response`; a request in: `awaiting_our_response`;
- a response with `hcx_status` `response.partial`: `partial`; any other response: `completed`;
- nothing matched: `unknown`. The last message that matched sets the state.
